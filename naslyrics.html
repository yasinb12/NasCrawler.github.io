<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I keep some E&amp;J, sittin bent up in the stairway</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the celo champs</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Laughin at baseheads, tryin to sell some broken amps</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">G-Packs get off quick, forever niggaz talk shit</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Remeniscing about the last time the Task Force flipped</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Niggaz be runnin through the block shootin</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Pick the Mac up, told brothers, "Back up," the Mac spit</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So now I'm jetting to the building lobby</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">and it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">(So whatchu sayin?) It's like the game ain't the same</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Got younger niggaz pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Same niggaz'll catch a back to back, snatchin yo' cracks in black</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">There was a snitch on the block gettin niggaz knocked</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So hold your stash until the coke price drop</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">It drops deep as it does in my breath</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Don't go against the grain simple and plain</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">is rich or doin years in the hundreds</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I switched my motto -- instead of sayin f*ck tomorrow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin</span></p>

<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">people play, bust the problems of the world today</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Before a blunt, I take out my fronts</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">That's like Malcolm X, catchin the Jungle Fever</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">40-side is the place that is giving me grace</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Now wait, another dose and you might be dead</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And ain't a damn thing gonna change</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I'ma performer (?) show the mic warmer was born to gain</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Nas, why did you do it?</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">It's like that, you know it's like that</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So I react never calmly on a hype track</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I set it off with my own rhyme</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">in your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">This is exercise 'til the microphone dies</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Back in eighty-three I was an MC sparking</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">kick my little raps cause I thought niggaz wouldn't understand</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And now in every jam I'm the f*ckin man</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I used to watch C.H.I.P.S., now I load glock clips</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Versatile, my style switches like a faggot</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Cuz in the streets, I'm well known like the number man</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">In my place wit the bass and format</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And next time I rhyme, I be foul</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggaz say I'm wow</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I hate a rhymebiter's rhyme</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime</span></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p8"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I got it goin on, even flip 'em on this song</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Every afternoon, I kick half the tune</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARCs hit</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I be slayin them fast, doing this that and the third</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">But chill, past to Andre, and let's slay</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Puttin hits on 5-0</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Csudr when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo'-fo'</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And biters can't come near</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Chocolate blunts make me see him drop in my weed smoke</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Your telephone blowing, black stitches or fat shoelaces</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic four-four I let blow</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Pumping for something, some uprise, plus some fail</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Judges hanging niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">But maintain when you come home the corner's ours</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So stay civilised, time flies</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Though incarcerated your mind (dies)</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I hate it when your moms cries</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love</span></p>
<p class="p7"><span class="s2"></span><br></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">F*ck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So I be ghost from my projects</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I take my pen and pad for the weekend</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Hitting L's while I'm sleeping</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">A two day stay, you may say I needed time alone</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">F*cking with the corners have a nigga up in Belleville</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">A future in a maximum state pen is grim</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty doo-wop</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Rollin two Phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oowops</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce"</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">'cos when the pistol blows the one that's murdered will be the cool one</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Tough luck when niggas are struck, families f*cked up</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Keep an eye out for Jake shorty wop</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">One love</span></p>

<p class="p6"><span class="s2">Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">After being blessed by the herb's essence</span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s2">I'm back to my rest, ten minutes some odd seconds</span></p>
