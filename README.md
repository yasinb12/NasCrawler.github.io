Repo for 200+ pages of training data (Nas' lyrics) for a text generation RNN

*DISCLAIMER: Coarse Language in Training Data*

I got inspired by TensorFlow's Text Generation RNN tutorial. 
The tutorial's default training data consisted of thousands of lines from Shakespeare's greatest works.
The first poets I got exposed to went by names like 'Q-Tip' and 'Mecca', not 'The Bard'.
Needless to say, I thought the tutorial could be changed up a bit.

So, I found a page with Nas' rap lyrics, thinking I could train the RNN with a few songs. 
I got tired of manually copying the lyrics into a text file, so I used BeautifulSoup to scrape all of Nas' rap lyrics starting from the Hip-Hop classic, Illmatic.
