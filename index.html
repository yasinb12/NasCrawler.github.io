 <pre>
Rappers I monkey flip em with the funky rhythm I be kickin
Musician, inflictin composition
of pain I'm like Scarface sniffin cocaine
Holdin a M-16, see with the pen I'm extreme, now
Bulletholes left in my peepholes
I'm suited up in street clothes
Hand me a nine and I'll defeat foes
Y'all know my steelo with or without the airplay
I keep some E&J, sittin bent up in the stairway
Or either on the corner bettin Grants with the celo champs
Laughin at baseheads, tryin to sell some broken amps
G-Packs get off quick, forever niggaz talk shit
Remeniscing about the last time the Task Force flipped
Niggaz be runnin through the block shootin
Time to start the revolution, catch a body head for Houston
Once they caught us off guard, the Mac-10 was in the grass and
I ran like a cheetah with thoughts of an assassin
Pick the Mac up, told brothers, "Back up," the Mac spit
Lead was hittin niggaz one ran, I made him backflip
Heard a few chicks scream my arm shook, couldn't look
Gave another squeeze heard it click yo, my shit is stuck
Try to cock it, it wouldn't shoot now I'm in danger
Finally pulled it back and saw three bullets caught up in the chamber
So now I'm jetting to the building lobby
and it was filled with children probably couldn't see as high as I be
(So whatchu sayin?) It's like the game ain't the same
Got younger niggaz pullin the triggers bringing fame to they name
and claim some corners, crews without guns are goners
In broad daylight, stickup kids, they run up on us
Fo'-fives and gauges, Macs in fact
Same niggaz'll catch a back to back, snatchin yo' cracks in black
There was a snitch on the block gettin niggaz knocked
So hold your stash until the coke price drop
I know this crackhead, who said she gotta smoke nice rock
And if it's good she'll bring ya customers in measuring pots, but yo
You gotta slide on a vacation
Inside information keeps large niggaz erasin and they wives basin
It drops deep as it does in my breath
I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death
Beyond the walls of intelligence, life is defined
I think of crime when I'm in a New York state of mind

I woke up early on my born day, I'm twenty years of blessing
The essence of adolescent leaves my body now I'm fresh in
My physical frame is celebrated cause I made it
One quarter through life some God-ly like thing created
Got rhymes 365 days annual plus some
Load up the mic and bust one, cuss while I puffs from
my skull cause it's pain in my brain vein money maintain
Don't go against the grain simple and plain
When I was young at this I used to do my thing hard
Robbin foreigners take they wallets they jewels and rip they green cards
Dipped to the projects flashin my quick cash
and got my first piece of ass smokin blunts with hash
Now it's all about cash in abundance, niggaz I used to run with
is rich or doin years in the hundreds
I switched my motto -- instead of sayin f*ck tomorrow
That buck that bought a bottle could've struck the lotto
Once I stood on the block, loose cracks produce stacks
I cooked up and cut small pieces to get my loot back
Time is Illmatic keep static like wool fabric
Pack a four-matic that crack your whole cabbage

I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets, makes my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a six-cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip we box up crazy bitches aimin guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housin police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money gettin style, rollin foul
The versatile, honey stickin wild, golden child
Dwellin in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days, we sell it, smoke pays
While all the old folks pray, to Je-sus' soakin they sins in trays
of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin a word best describin my life, to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How ya livin large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin coke or playin spit spades in strip poker

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin big Willie style
Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games
people play, bust the problems of the world today
  
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X, catchin the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'ma performer (?) show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
in your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in eighty-three I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
kick my little raps cause I thought niggaz wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the f*ckin man
I rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S., now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
Cuz in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and format
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggaz say I'm wow
I hate a rhymebiter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime
 
I got it goin on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARCs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, past to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Puttin hits on 5-0
Csudr when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo'-fo'
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out
  
  
I rap for listeners, blunt heads, fly ladies and prisoners
Hennessey holders and old school niggas, then I be dissin a unofficial that smoke woolie thai
I dropped out of Kooley High, gassed up by a cokehead cutie pie
Jungle survivor, f*ck who's the liver
My man put the battery in my back, a differencem from Energizer
Sentence begins indented with formality
My duration's infinite, moneywise or physiology
Poetry, that's a part of me, retardedly bop
I drop the ancient manifested hip-hop, straight off the block
I reminisce on park jams, my man was shot for his sheep coat
Chocolate blunts make me see him drop in my weed smoke
It's real, grew up in trife life, did times or white lines
The hype vice, murderous nighttimes, and knife fights invite crimes
Chill on the block with Cognac, hold strap
with my peeps that's into drug money, market into rap
No sign of the beast in the blue Chrysler, I guess that means peace
For niggas no sheisty vice to just snipe you
Start off the dice-rolling mats for craps to cee-lo
With sidebets, I roll a deuce, nothing below (peace God!)
Peace God -- now the shit is explained
I'm taking niggas on a trip straight through memory lane
It's like that you all it's like that you all it's like that you all

One for the money
Two for pussy and foreign cars
Three for Alize niggas deceased or behind bars
I rap divine Gods check the prognosis, is it real or showbiz?
My window faces shootouts, drug overdoses
Live amongst no roses, only the drama, for real
A nickel-plate is my fate, my medicine is the ganja
Here's my basis, my razor embraces, many faces
Your telephone blowing, black stitches or fat shoelaces
Peoples are petrol, dramatic automatic four-four I let blow
and back down po-po when I'm vexed so
my pen taps the paper then my brain's blank
I see dark streets, hustling brothers who keep the same rank
Pumping for something, some uprise, plus some fail
Judges hanging niggas, uncorrect bails, for direct sales
My intellect prevails from a hanging cross with nails
I reinforce the frail, with lyrics that's real
Word to Christ, a disciple of streets, trifle on beats
I decipher prophecies through a mic and say peace.
I hung around the older crews while they sling smack to dingbats
They spoke of Fat Cat, that nigga's name made bell rings, black
Some fiends scream, about Supreme Team, a Jamaica Queens thing
Uptown was Alpo, son, heard he was kingpin, yo
F*ck "rap is real", watch the herbs stand still
Never talking to snakes 'cause the words of man kill
True in the game, as long as blood is blue in my veins
I pour my Heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane

What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib
F*ck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
F*cking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach - it's bugged
Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? one love

Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind (dies)
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love

Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
F*ck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hitting L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible
F*cking with the corners have a nigga up in Belleville
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty doo-wop
Rollin two Phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oowops
He said, "Nas, niggas could be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce"
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'cos when the pistol blows the one that's murdered will be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families f*cked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake shorty wop
One love


Check it out
When I'm chillin, I grab the buddha, get my crew to buy beers
And watch a flick, illin and root for the villian, huh
Plus every morning, I go out and love it sort of chilly
Then I send a shorty from my block to the store for Phillies
After being blessed by the herb's essence
I'm back to my rest, ten minutes some odd seconds
That's where I got the honey at, spends the night for sexing
Cheap lubrication, Lifestyle protection
Picking up my stereo's remote control quickly
Ron G's in the cassette deck, rockin the shit, G
I try to stay mellow, rock, well acapella rhymes'll
make me richer than a slipper made Cinderella fella
Go get your crew, Hobbes, I'm prepared to bomb troops
Got niggaz who's born, I shot my way out my Mom Dukes
When I was ten, I was a hip-hoppin shorty wop
Known for rocking microphones and twisting off a 40 top, yeah


Right, right, what up niggaz, how y'all, it's Nasty the villian
I'm still writin rhymes but besides that I'm chillin
I'm trying to get this money, God, you know the hard times, kid
Shit, cold be starvin make you wanna do crimes kid
But I'ma lamp, cuz a crime couldn't beat a rhyme
Niggaz catching 3 to 9's, Muslims yelling free the mind
And I'm from Queensbridge, been to many places
as a kid when I would say that out of town, niggaz chased us
But now I know the time, got a older mind
Plus control a nine, fine, see now I represent mine
I'm new on the rap scene, brothers never heard of me
Yet I'm a meance, yo, police wanna murder me
Heine(ken) Dark drinker, represent the thinker
My pen rides the paper, it even has blinkers
Think I'll dim the lights then inhale, it stimulates
Floating like I'm on the North 95 Interstate
Never plan to stop, when I write my hand is hot
And expand alot from the Wiz to Camelot
The parlayer, I'll make ya heads bop Pah
I shine a light on perpetrators like a cop's car
From day to night, I play the mic and you'll thank God
I wreck shit so much, the microphone'll need a paint job
My brain is incarcerated
Live at any jam, I couldn't count all the parks I raided
I hold a Mac-11, and attack the Reverand
I contact 11 L's and max in heaven


Straight up shit is real and any day could be your last in the jungle
Get murdered on the humble, guns'll blast, niggaz tumble
The corners is the hot spot, full of mad criminals
who don't care, guzzlin beers, we all stare
at the out-of-towners (Ay, yo, yo, who that?) They better break North
before we get the four pounders, and take their face off
The streets is filled with undercovers, homicide chasin brothers
The D.A.'s on the roof, tryin to, watch us and knock us
And killer coppers, even come through in helicopters
I drink a little vodka, spark a L and hold a Glock for
the fronters, wannabe ill niggaz and spot runners
Thinkin it can't happen til I, trap em and clap em
and leave em done, won't even run about Gods
I don't believe in none of that shit, your facts are backwards
Nas is a rebel of the street corner
Pullin a Tec out the dresser, police got me under pressure


Yo, they call me Nas, I'm not your legal type of fella
Moet drinkin, marijuana smokin street dweller
who's always on the corner, rollin up blessed
When I dress, it's never nuttin less than Guess
Cold be walkin with a bop and my hat turned back
Love committin sins and my friends sell crack
This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue
The school drop-out, never liked the shit from day one
cause life ain't shit but stress fake niggaz and crab stunts
So I guzzle my Hennesey while pullin on mad blunts
The brutalizer, crew de-sizer, accelerator
The type of nigga who be pissin in your elevator
Somehow the rap game reminds me of the crack game
Used to sport Bally's and Gazelle's with black frames
Now I'm into fat chains, sex and Tecs
Fly new chicKs and new kicks, Heine's and Beck's


No doubt; see my, stacks are fat, this is what it's about
Before the BDP conflict with MC Shan
Around the time when Shante dissed the Real Roxxane
I used to wake up every mornin, see my crew on the block
Every day's a different plan that had us runnin from cops
If it wasn't hangin out in front of cocaine spots
We was at the candy factory, breakin the locks
Nowadays, I need the green in a flash just like the next man
F*ck a yard God, let me see a hundred grand
Could use a gun Son, but f*ck bein the wanted man
but if I hit rock bottom then I'ma be the Son of Sam
Then call the crew to get live too
with Swoop, Hakim, my brother Jungle, Big Bo, cooks up the blow
Mike'll chop it, Mayo, you count the profit
My shit is on the streets, this way the Jakes'll never stop it
It's your brain on drugs, to all fly bitches and thugs
Nuff respect to the projects, I'm ghost, One Love


One time for your motherf*ckin mind
This goes out to everybody in New York
that's livin the real f*ckin life
And every projects, all over
To my man, Big Will he's still here [echoes]
The 40 side of Vernon
My man Big L.E.S.
Big Cee-Lo from the Don
Shawn Penn, the 40 busters
My crew the shorty busters
The 41st side of Vernon posse
The Goodfellas
My man Cormega, Lakid Kid
Can't forget Drawers, the Hillbillies
My man Slate, Wallethead
Black Jay, Big Oogi
Crazy barrio spot (Big Dove)
We rock shit, Ph.D
And my man Primo, from GangStarr
(Ninety-four real shit y'all, Harry O!)
F*ck y'all crab ass niggaz though...
(Yeah, bitch ass niggas!) [etc.]


It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm +Ill+
plus +Matic+, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabotage me
I leave em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggaz is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops, givin mics men-e-straul cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin like a rasta in the weed spot
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop
Though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell
It ain't hard to tell

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak niggaz played out, get fucked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate wit my Dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
Yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin, Vegas style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin on Milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winnin them
Threats I'm sendin them, Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villians, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock I lace em
Fried broiled with basil, taste em, crack the legs
way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have em
fuckin me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon
Grab your gun it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight
with the broke Mac it won't spray right
Don't give a fuck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs, bug cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

I peeped you frontin, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin
Across the streat you was wildin
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the fuck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop so how the fuck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin L's sippin Coors, on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin war niggaz I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin the raw
But uhh, a thug changes, and love changes
and best friends become strangers, word up

Thug niggaz
Yo, to them thug niggaz gettin it on in the world you know?
To them niggaz that's locked down
doin they thing survivin yaknowmsayin?
To my thorough niggaz, New York and world wide
Yo to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit.. The Firm clique, Illmatic nigga
It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin
Y'all fake niggaz, tryin to copy
better come with the real though
Fake ass niggaz yo..
(They throw us slugs we throwin em back, what?)
Bring the shit man, live man
(fuck that son)
Nine-six shit..

Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key
Everybody's lookin for somethin..
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin for somethin..

My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catchin feelings

From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-top BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this

Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, givin a fuck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny? Gettin put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

Damn! Look how muh-fuckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the fuck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the fuck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a fuck about a nigga like me right?
Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherfuckin gun
I can't believe this shit....
Word up.. (word up..)

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab and me bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired
A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves
under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads


How you like me now? I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggaz shock me
I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears
fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me
Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place
where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand

Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf
His eyes bubblin, he said, "It was on"
I felt his palm troubled him shakin
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?"
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!


They never realized, how real Nas, is so decisive
It's just the likeness, of Isrealites mist, that made me write this
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasin down your prime time
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis
on how we creep quick, fuckin your wife that ain't so secret
It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me
My gator brand is Maurry, walkin through rough land before me
where the snakes put a smile on they face, hopin and prayin I'm stuck
Scopin they lay in the cut, weighin my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winkin at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be stickin you
The mag inside the triple goose
Face down on the floors, the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the braggin raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant


Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Now how can I perfect this (uhh, what)
livin reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, drivin a Lexus with a death wish
Jettin, checkin my message on the speaker
Boppin to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD crankin, doin ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinkin and thinkin
My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on to one seekin enlightment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo
My "fuck Tommorrow" motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar the desperado - word to Cus D'Amato

Got to watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

Some niggaz watch you (uh) see you when you think on the low
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow
Three ki's, new V's, went to Anguilla with your hoe
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, gettin the dough
Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listenin just bobbin your head
Your Roley shinin, thinkin to yourself nobody's takin mine
At the same time, your hoe is gettin snatched from behind
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know -
- you knew these niggaz all your life
What made them mark you victim, you fucked up somehwere down the line
now they had to target your Wisdom
She took em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen sick of yappin
Dump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out
Coulda passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes

Yo; I never brag, how real I keep it, cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
in a Lex watchin Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A tec squeezin - executioner, winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular, center of attraction
Climaxin, my bitches they be laughin
They high from sniffin coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin, Sergio Tachinni flippin mad pies
low price, I blow dice and throw em
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the "Do or Die" slogan
My niggaz roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', sprayin shots like a drumroll
Blankin out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I seperate, watchin crab niggaz marinate
I'm all about tecs and good jooks and sex
Israelite books, holdin government names from Ness
MC's are crawlin out, every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

Currency is made in trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind, and Fire singing reasons why I'm
up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champange from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
in a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shittin like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
in the basement - chilling on the via with Mumia
for wearin chrome - I told the judge snakes slither
like Sharon Stone, but like Capone I'm thrown (yo)

Lyrical, ly-lyrical mission..
Lyrical..
Yo the time is wastin, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin, court pen pacin
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We livin in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealin boy
Coke suppliers actin biased
Cause rumors say that niggaz wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's --
-- just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it?
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggaz transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peelin off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggaz with the tecs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug,
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga
Yeah, yo, offical Queensbridge murderers
Mobb Deep keep it real though
Motherfuckin AZ yo
'Mega, 'Mega, whatever
Scarlett O'Hara
Yo, Fox Boogie
East New York
Gambo, Brownsville
Wizard, Fort Rockaway
Big Jersey
Connecticut, D.C., Sudan
V.A. ?? N.C., L.A.
So on and so on...
Big Ha, Houston Fifth Ward
Black Ed, keep it real Moe..

The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holdin out
Let the streets be the court - and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86 ??, foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Solicitin, ill editions of that Murder I WRote
A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on top of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes, chrome kitted up
Cali ?? lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutchin gats quick to bust
But knowin how these niggaz tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot, without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you


In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face, like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands too
Make examples, substantial amounts you owe, to the fam
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasin
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, Blazin hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
compared to these niggaz who swear to be real
but impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin bills to send to all my jail niggaz who fell
From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's somethin venereal
but back in stereo

From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all
Fly gangsta, wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck
rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond roll, hustlin low -
pro-file, white gold style, rakin bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive he strugglin for the phone
Fo'-fo' blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung

Yo, my mind is seein through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes, we lust papes
and push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin, he just finished biddin upstate
And now the projects, is talkin that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
"Life's a Bitch," but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars
Movin cars, your top papi Senor Escobar


Check the shit
My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggaz actin illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it
Them niggaz sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleamin, niggaz was scheamin
Seen the ill Beamers beamin
Triple-beam and doublin cream, had em feenin
to get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my 'rat beggin me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav got a soldier
It's gettin down it's goin down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin back tears
Told these broads, to put it in gear
with two females that don't smile diggin they style yo
Whattup son, these niggaz done started somethin wild
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holdin the steel, I paid attention to the females
Maintain bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload
and still handle the wheel, point em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I layed back Escobar status, knowin The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born wit


Hold it right there pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told ya
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin boulders
He's stuntin, after he left my man like that
without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus
and Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness
and step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight parasuco, with young faces
can turn niggaz Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused
by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
if they had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?"
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, "Don't grab Boo"
They started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when
they jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin
We followed them pollyin, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin too slow
We both holdin, what if them wild hoes started foldin?
Sosa, said say no more, we started rollin
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin
There the girls go, hurry up we out in
the 940, me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggaz got murdered in the orgy


A young wild beautiful love child
You like them thug style link rockin, then mink coppin
Hit you on the sink a hundred dollar drink poppin
The head'll make you take him shoppin, a foul doctrine
Reminiscent of my first time up in a chick
You was innocent, but now you rent-a-dick, wear the tightest shit
Chanel lookin real, airbrushed nails
Hit the gym, hit the scales, heaven-sent but negligent (so fine..)
To see a prophecy, your ebony tone is lockin me
The way you moan make me daydream of you on top of me
Wishin I could be the one man; but you juggle
way too many Willies all in one hand
You wanna run up in clubs, gettin rubbed on
Niggaz pull your hair, shake your fat rear
Get your fuck on - followin week, you back there
But what you stuck on, weed, clowns and cars
Puffin with some lil nigga, husband not knowin she's out
Could you believe Eve, Mother Earth of the seas
Niggaz thirst you, you just let em hurt you and leave
What up mah, frontin like you naive
Pusherman's whip, callin police when you flip
Can't understand it, yo it should be a throne for us
But for now that's a whole different zone from us, word!

Like Isis, she got you heartbroke and felt lifeless
Grow up girl instead you want revenge so now you act the nicest
to who'sever gettin down and trifless
To get his mind all you do is give him somethin priceless
Cause in time he'll realize the thighs is all he needs
More than weed, then you hit him off with lies and greed (deceit, yeah)
There you go again, startin wars, makin me more yours
Seem to get a kick out of keepin me on all fours
Face glistenin, I'm addicted to you
Original, Wisdom Body got me picturin you
Igloos of ice trickin on you, you never listen
to this nigga spendin Franklins on tennis anklets
Must've had a bad deal in the past though
Can't even keep it real with a nigga with cash flow
Say men are all the same, what we need to do is break this chain
You got a job part-time and school's your night thing
With dreams to settle down, it ain't far from now
You gettin interviewed, but your boss is into gettin screwed
Typical day that the black girl sees
Comin home wantin more from a college degree


Where are you focused, on legit niggaz and where the coke is
Nice and Thug Life niggaz, yo you seem hopeless
Your value - too much to be measured, I wonder how you
could ever be played, your pussy worth gold amountin to
more than the world, but not knowin nothin about you
You leavin the crib, takin all your kids out to
drop them off, lettin some nigga knock you off
So hot and soft, that's the same thing that got you lost (you should be ashamed)
Growin up seein it, it should remind you, you bein lied to
Everything that move be inside you
Sacred as you are, left with these wannabes to guide you
I watched you, hard to knock you, I tried not to
They spot you out dancin topless in your drawers
Damn look, there goes a black girl lost

t was a murder
Jake just hit the corner people swarming
Three in the morning I jumped out my cab like "fuck,
niggaz is buck," mega bloodshed, the tapes red
I heard some bird whisper, "Yo he should have ducked"
I puffed the lilla, just before I hit the scene for rilla
I'm all high it's late I'm looking down at the fella
Shit's pushed in, ambulance placed him on some cushion
His mom's had a stare I wouldn't dare second look when I murk
It hurt, kind of took it as a brief reminder
that the street's designed to stop your life, plot
The beast in time yeah, cell to cell suspect ass nigga you fell
First time locked in crime stop my mind blocks the frail
Bursting blasting at your forty cal shell, split your dry cell
My niggas never snitch why tell
We roll with no regrets, destiny's, fifty's and equities
Queens'll be the death of me


Dear God, I want the riches, money hungry bitches infested
Giving the jealous niggas sickness, the witness
My crew dresses, in vest-es, feel the essence
Try to test this, scientist, able and reckless
Slaughter, Nautica'd down, frames look petite
Ten millis, mix designed just for my physique
I keep a low pro as if I owe, bless the flow lovely
My pants hang low while I'm dancing, sipping the bubbly
Hey, me no worry, hashish keep my eyes Chinese
Rollin two Phillies together make blunts Siamese
I meant it, I represent it, descendant made of
early natives that were captured and taught to think backwards
Trapped us in a cracker psychiatric, it's massive
A Million Man March, alert the masses
Ten glocks, Armani in small print, upon my glasses
Don assassins, armageddon, the wettin'
Never freakin the beast, seven heads, got the righteous threatened
Life Was Written, the plot curves behind the settin'
Comprehend the grammar, Manfrione -- are you the type of nigga
to shoot a leg to get your name known? I flip the brain tome
Niggaz get hit and wrap the plastic
The mic I strike in vain givin the pain of what a Mack is
What you with? Luchi or drama, no sleep means insomnia
No need to check the clock, the streets are timin you

It justifies, Nas Escobar's leavin shit mesmerized
Mega live, like the third world
Decipher my deceiver make him a believer
Spitting jim stars, words in my mic ttype receiver
Bond is my life so I live by my word
Never fraudulent Queensbridge don't make no herbs
Spread my name to deacons, politicians while they speakin
Rebel to America civilization caught you sleepin

Yo, release what's in me
Besides the Henny, it's eyes that's seen plenty
Fiends get skinny as if Queens was a Craig Jenny
Instead of diet plans it's crack 200 grams
I pump a G-pack, peeping for where the D's at
It's slow, lookin for Rambo, the cop who got grazed
Back in the days, chasin niggaz through my project maze
That cop he got a death wish
He run behind niggaz until you breathless
Everyday he makin ten arrests, sheeit
My nigga check this, I know the bitch he rest with
I even blessed it, forty-dash-ten inspect it
(Already checked it Dunn, near his ankle you could see his gun)
Peep, he parked his Jeep in the back of the slum
to check Tanisha, fat ass real fly, with the blonde caesar
Vetacini summer gear, she push the two-seater
I heard she brag about the way he eat her
A Irish man short slim with a tan, they say he laced her cheeba
She do be lookin weaker, now her teeth are foul
Speakin loud, peep her style, in and out of every reefer cloud
Fat ass dissolvin, like cotton candy in a mouth that's starvin
Rock the same gear daily, like a soldier in my squadron
I heard she let Jake investigate from her window
cause she's a nympho, suckin dick and coughin up info
So now it's set up, her and the beast to get wet up
I know he vest up, we blazin from the neck up
(Yo let me knock first) Soon as he open it your glock burst
They had the chains on, son hit the lock first
We busted in the cop jerked
Jungle popped one in his shirt
I grabbed the bitch by her tits, she tried to say she Earth
We saw the cameras, tape recorders, and the monitors
They eyein us (Nas yo he survived one from the fo'-five)
Pull his shades down, they seen his last days now
There's no way now, we can be treated just like a slave now
Two in the dome, he's laid down, aiyyo the bitch is saved now
She's living in a snitch grave now


Shootouts is similar to Wild West
Broad daylight, face to face without a vest
You know the episodes, thugs camouflage the spectacles
Please God to save the life that the Devil sold
See  It Was Written  but was never told
Peep the jewels black man, it's even better than gold
Niggaz roll with iron, police roll in hot pursuit
tryin to stop the loot, fuck Jake, cock and shoot

Still on the streets with my peeps so deep
We threw a block party for my man goin up creek
to do his two to four, niggaz show love, from all around the board
Peace Lord, Sony Handi-Cam on record
Pop a bottle, cause when you come home we still got it sewn
We can watch the tape play back and just zone
Film all the bitches, on the benches with ill extensions
We block the streets off, only crew cars can enter
Music was loud and it was crowded
Barbecued wings we fed the fiends (gamble in the back) Killa shouted
And Frank tried to stop the bank loss, about what a Roley cost
Guzzled his drink, and staggered off
He's a Big Will, used to slang krill, now he own the hill
Couldn't take losin his cash, and I could feel
somethin in the air yeah, Frank returned with Pierre
A gun slinger, who niggaz hadn't seen in a year
I usually be holdin - 'specially this type of weekend
And everyone except for me had started reachin
They had gats in each others faces, with kids
and grandmothers around, Frank's only concern was his paper
My man Killa let off, half of them fake niggaz jet off
Police blitz quick, waitin for that to set off
Runnin the static, it got me mad cause they a bunch of faggots
Startin shit in my hood, I can't have it
Yo High, get the 40-cali stainless, Jake is still out
Let's make it real and still make them niggaz famous
Dip behind trees in fatigues and squeeze, dodge and weave
Hearin Jake retaliatin, and Wiz was up the alley waitin
We breeze, jump in the ride, heard Pierre died
Internal bleedin inside, and ain't been back since ninety-five

Niggaz thinkin shit sweet, I carry big heat
Wavy hair chipped teeth, up in this bitch deep
Queens murder clicks meet, yellow tapes on black gates
Mediterranean, projects is like Kuwait
I escape into zones, that's irregular
Why debate on a phone, I'm solar cellular
Escobar 600, you just a crumb inside a world
where the rich run it, curriculum of a mathologist
Deep throats, they try to swallow this
Anthropologists, dynasties of great knowledgists
I preserve in my dome, niggaz mics is full of silicone
Spot's blown, guerilla ice on this killer's life
I put my word on it
Now you can sleep on or rock a swerve on it
Nas is menage a trois' on Mount Aire lodges
We like a smooth fam', but rougher than how DeBarge is
Catchin charges, of marksmen, livin heartless
Grab a cartridge, cock my shit on some Mobb shit
We mobbin, puttin niggaz in mausoleums
From Queens cross the Throsnic, heads bop, I see 'em
from queens cross to throgsneck heads nod


Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue behind my waters
No welfare supporters more conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got not evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate knowledge
of coke was cooked without the garbage we'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin, fashion
Designer clothes, lacing your click up with diamond vogues
Your people holdin dough, no parole
No rubbers, go in raw imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
watch the blimp read "The World Is Mine"


The way to be, paradise like relaxin black, latino and anglo-saxon
Armani exchange the reins
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin, type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controlling, click rollin
Trickin six digits on kicks and still holdin
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Gimme one shot I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisonner set free, stress free
No work release purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities and reverse themes to Willies
It sounds foul but every girl I meet to go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica send em to Africa

If I ruled the world
Imagine that
I'd free all my sons, I love em love em baby
Black diamonds and pearls
Could it be, if you could
be mine, we'd both shine
If I ruled the world
Still livin for today, in
these last days and times

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land
We'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land


You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Runnin from Jake, gettin chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate we carry weight
Tryin to get laced, flip the ace stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cop camera
Makin moves in Atlanta, back and forth scrambler
Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga havin shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck??


It's sort of like the conclusion, the color purple
Niggas is losing, confusion, with one time all pursuit moves in
Grabbing niggas up in this movement to rule shit
Cop verses the block, shorties is too quick
Lesson number one. If you're arrested and hung
Where niggas is from gotta keep a lid on your tongue
It's like silent murder, I hit blunts hard like Ray Mercer
the violent words of a prince in a palace of Persia.
The cognac plurger plus the trees,
but whose the faul one to make his nose take a freeze,
and got enough gold to rock ice in all hype.
Used to be a general but just lost his stripe
Pipe dreams and white feinds and all-nighters, collect calls from lifers
Astoria walls with cypress, since I got a problem with the law-writers,
I kick some more items just to explore horizons,
the palm lady dreamt of this day so I'ma play,
the crib close smokin' with the big toast and lay

Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the top lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not? It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog
to my building -- come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
Niggaz gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare
with dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
The sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick
when he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggaz still hangin, years passed and slang changin
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth
could've got us all wasted, what a fuckin clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?

I'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
Cause I ain't playin, niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids
fuck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South
comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggaz, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin

New York, New York
New York, New York


Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest


You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on top there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

It's a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game stop, and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors
Plottin I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaws
Tried, stickin me up, but I flipped on these ducks (you tried)
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up (that's what you get)
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the fury of man
Became a monster, on top of the world, never fallin
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin
C'mon


Yo, yo yo yo
Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant -- her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Ki's of dope, lovin cats to ski in her dope
She fuck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passin for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shoppin when she not, coppin bricks of that shit
She hoppin on dicks, ridin Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin for jewerly
Her bodyguard screwin me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothin new to me, blowin backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg
Yo niggaz said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her"
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to fuck
She knew about, cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never cough once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, not since he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work

It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world
Watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home
from Attica known, for keepin chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
Five years plannin to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.
Started robbin niggaz til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin niggaz he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard"
Layin with his bitch, niggaz is rich, is what he told her
Played the block, holdin cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossin fast
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash

It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again nigga
It's a small world, no doubt ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
we let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull
Another thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite
black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore, got niggaz hit up yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive
He was live - do niggaz even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks - incidents where po-lice died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)
He starin at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit em
I'm reachin for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on
At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin
out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
but can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down? Never
Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar

It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you won't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
where beef, never ends
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

("I'm going to see you again..
Uh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga..
Uh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah..")

Nuttin but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin, think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me
that's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggaz, come through for niggaz
Scarface get a call and we shootin niggaz
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?


A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five mercedes
Attack em like Freddie, then we toastin over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
with a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, fuck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa


Whattup Big? You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
We used to fuck R&B Bitches and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
_Machine Gun Funk_, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But fuck it black, you livin your life, though your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggaz is wrong -- usin your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king? It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on top, the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there; I feel some
but doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not cause I'm fake
cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin
Tellin me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin that's _Ready to Die_
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

Thug Life never die..

Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth
to bite off beer tops, and _Pour Out a Lil' Liquor_
You was more than just the wildest nigga
 2Pacalypse, I understand your style nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin, offendin me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
 All Eyez on You , niggaz in your face invadin your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride, before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could _Never Be Peace_ I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on "the realest shit you ever wrote"
We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the top
but kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and stopped
in NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggaz would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
and make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

  

I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around
Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said "Baby bless"
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's, and finally it's lookin good
Hip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain
a couple pounds tryin to maintain -- one day you here
the next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out
Some is bout it, most individuals plots
and run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than fifty percent of us
endin up with holes through the chest
through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way outta this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack
To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

.. always survive.. but why?

Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggaz just stay alive

 
As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
with big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
from Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
but hold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's
with blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin, from past to present times, heaven shines
light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
to sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
may we break away from the chains abroad

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

You wanna buy time? I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
he can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin for nuttin but takin
Headed for nuttin but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin
Judges is not relatin to pleas, guns bustin where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
in bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past
and a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin harder than the generations here before he came
Goin through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

I'm the most wanted baby fathe, save the drama
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
you thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim
but I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you ridin with me
You keep askin, "When do you have time for me?"
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit tryin
before you find what you lookin for and get to cryin
You always sayin what you gon' do if you catch me lyin

  
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister
I feel no guilt when I twist ya
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his key
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig peice
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
but I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doin his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely
but I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby


Thinking of me you gettin the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open; but -- you just my close friend
Get it baby?

Swing a mack to be live cart ack to get high
It's the ghetto life yea I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it
Now y'all combinin all the countries we goin do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang
It ain't all about a black and white thing

What y'all waitin for the world to blow up
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before ? is

Fake black leaders of puppets always talking bout the city budget

People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this

Hope you're listenin, turn up your transisterin
Hot 97, KISS-FM
or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin with your girl while you thinkin bout ya ex
Not too easy not too complex
I break it down, how to adress, the opposite sex
Problems or questions, I can answer them best
Signin off Dr. Knockboot at your request, peace

Rest havens
fuck y'all bitches
Y'all niggaz get y'all shit tight
Dr. Knockboot gotta come take y'all bitches from ya!
AIGHT?! We out!

Yo ill will, ruff ryders
what what, sraight like that

You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that i wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penatentary, sending me letters i answer back
That eventually, we all be bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, fuck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast ,nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say i did the right thing

Make history before you go
fuck the misery, you po we gettin doe
Except the ?dollars? other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is viable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Payin doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
prepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga


Get yours nigga
Cuz Imma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to ya'll
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killas crawl
And snitches call police
All these niggas and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces & startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Betta slow up
Before you get your ass on up
Nigga never gonna grow up
Drinkin' the Henney
But her know he gonna throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? The future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted & ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace chasin' the papas
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things


When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style Imma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of ya'll can't come close to?
Some of ya'll
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when ya'll niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I stop and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I'm glad ya'll stopped and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga nod
Rocks are glistenin'
Can't stop my mission
Make anotha LP drop
I'm hittin'
With the new shit exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is ya'll bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

I go past ya'll
Ya'll got the glass jar
And when I hit it, admit it
Ya'll on ya'll ass ya'll
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gun up the dough
You want to score
But you really don't want to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me
Is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out
Where ya clique now
Where you sit now
In the back seat
Mad cuz I flip styles
And I pack heat
Make you run laps
Like a pro athlete
An' I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
Imma tell you what's real
An' what could stop you from makin' a mil
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high wit you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
Cuz they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me
I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown on Berry Gordy
Good God


Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
Cuz now I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
Cuz now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things


  

Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On rooftops, tape cd covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin large, takin it light
Pushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N - A - S are the letters that spell . . .
NAS, NAS



Nas is like.." Earth Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
"Nas is like.." Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blastin, techs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Makin choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is


"Nas is like.." Sex to a nympho, but nothin sweet
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'
I'm the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it, and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night
Now..


She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin we can stay together

  
I see you dressed up in white face covered in vail
Do I hear wedding bells? My dogs throwin rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
to a real man that gently put the ring on your hand
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Drivin off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Somethin in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cuz I love you
Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't stop til I tell you me to beautiful
Deeper and harder love layin new with you
Runnin my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
while I'm wit you and I won't even care, word


She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
Til one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin this divorcin shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake
Half my car, half my kids? Can't get that
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look
With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen God bless you


The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I aint gonna loose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I dont know how to act
When she not around, Im heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey

Ohhh money, money, money,
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich

All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
Its so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
Im a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when Im not with you, Im off guard
Niggas always expect to see us 2 together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Dont need no pre-nup,
Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money

Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich

I wont sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you
Before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm wit you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
Its hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I like'd you better when you where illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical
Now when we fuck we use profalactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it
fucking me, I gave you back shots in ya ASSets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped

Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich

Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
at the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
Flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five
cause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin
Tellin my wife who I was dancin with like I was fuckin
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin
to the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin
Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when
got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
to the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
and lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin swingin on the ceilin fan, I stopped it
Swingin slower and slower..
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga
mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass
and she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin through

Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
"Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?"
I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years
what I just saw happenin -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga fuckin my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me"
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin out we out like kamikazes
We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide
Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin
Put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin
to Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
this'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen"
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, "Now unto God, we elope"

Queensbridge, 41st side
Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothafuckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin ten-ten winds a.m.
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin "Dunn" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, stop the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell

Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)

Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, english, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption


Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the top of the charts, got it jumpin off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse


I'm oblivious to you skeptics
What you hear you ain't ever hear 'til I repped it
Iridescent heroes essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message, air 'em out
Heard some people discussing my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move in style, wild, exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
"Oochie Wally" ideas
Sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed
Signed to Columbia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging about your past and
Thinking back on trips on Manhattan
Dad was rolling hotels like the plaza
Black bellhops holding
Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Just try to be the best you, man
That's all I can say, man)
No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Don't light over here, man
Put that away, man, put that away)
No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Tryna tell 'em, know what I'm saying?
Big Apple my Hennessy, please)
No bad energy please, no bad energy

To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirt, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper
Still miss Big Poppa

No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy

 

Yeah
Yeah

Literally rich, this Nas, sick
Still woulda hit a enemy with a TEC in nine-six
Exotic material on the neck and fly whips
I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to death
Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you with real millionaire shit
Escargot, my car fresh from the dealership
Esco alias, my escrow grow daily
It's the freshest Air Max wearer, yes
Ejaculatory depression after sex
And that mean after I nut, don't touch me, no questions
Unless she's a restless spirit then I can heal it
Spend a lot of time together, I know her feelings
But you fightin' what the essence of a woman is
I respect you, my love's limitless
But what are you becoming?
You wanna be the man or the woman? Play your position
Mornin' or night I'm lickin' the pudding ain't I?
Since my days of St. Ides
Pullin' out box cutters to bang opps who ain't us
To Bentley Continentals, see the man I is
Hand-to-hand hustlers always claiming they ran The Brizz
The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son
But if I was in the Juice Crew, we woulda won
No disrespect 'less disrespect served to me
You a gangsta groupie, gassin' niggas to murder me, nigga?
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
And that's word to Yammy, yeah
Deep roots, I ain't have to fake it yet
Old solid tree branches ain't breakin' yet
A vet

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

I got the je ne sais quoi, why bother
With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't by cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon, still
And that's word to Will, for real

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

Shout to Draws, Spanky, Black Ed, Hands
Shout to Shabazz, Wewop and Harvey
Rest in glory
TJ Killa Black, rest in glory
Shout to all the young legends we losin' too soon
Yeah


 


Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily


Everybody's not gon' get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
'Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

  ]
Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Here's the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday

  ]
Had a lot of losses
It hurt a lot losing cats but it was worth it
I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat 'cause I'm black and I'm ill
And I'm real and made millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it
I don't internalize it, I ignore it
I was taught to observe it
Not absorb it, so I don't absorb it

   & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same


Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling


Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 arena
You made it then it's crazy and now you gotta rock stadiums
I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front
Then the shade come, they try to say that your day is done


Melody
Married to harmony


Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same



 


In our younger days we were so in love
And the thought of losing you was enough
Can't lose me

Who be the holy prophet, they watchin' with all his posture?
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest, he gots to
Be from the '80s era
His tint is shade Carrera, Queens forever
Green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted-in rappers you go against me
You can't tantalize a call girl with just a roll of pennies
Can't bait a lion in ya trap without a tranquilizer
You enterin' a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like Avatar
Caviar black diamonds, can you imagine, y'all?
Takin' from a rich man plate, kick in his door
'Cause his war with the bloodsuckers of the poor
The first shall be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jouët pours, like this

Uh
I tell a story of a prince life and all his glory
It's killin' me softly
Somber like the buildings at Fort Green
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me, is this thing on?
Test, one, two, gimme some feedback if y'all could feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin' dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin' wit' ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up the sister
Lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin' up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and roadblocks
Police barricades, batterrams
Doors off the hinges, wake up flinchin', who ratted, man?
Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housin' added in
Every department searchin' your apartment
Ramsackin' it, found four ratchets
DEA jack us, we gotta escape the madness
Haha, yeah, escape the madness
Yeah, through the eyes of Pablo
That's how I'm lookin' at you, as an obstacle and everything
It's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dinin'
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for ridin'
Ties was suppliers for my days of the projects
Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the ambitions of a rider
Pretty amazon on my arm, nigga, I'm the flyest
The flyest, haha, yeah

Lemme hear that

 

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

She edu-ma-cated, she said she related to the Asian
Ethic persuasion, the sex is amazin'
Never bought her a Birkin, my night-time nurse
Maybe more like a surgeon, nice on the eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block that I would service
Said, "It's straight," we need a place up in Jamaica estates
And she was like, "Oh no" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, not be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evel Knievel, on the soul cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a Czar
Now she hit the town with the legal Escobar, she's my

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

We fresh outta the Met Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best-dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes, no trespassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids, but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost, back in the crib, some avocado toast
Laid-back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin', startin' to think about children
And bringin' 'em in the world with Kim Jung illin'
But since I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willin', she's willin', we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are, in this Western Civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his whole party

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (yo)

Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

 

F*ck outta here, second guessin' our love
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cookbook, you gossipin', watchin' hip-hop & love, uh

I don't mean to be brass, even a genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends, they don't mess with rappers, correction
I'm Akhenaten, King Tut's predecessor
I fantasize, and no mind him, I'm slick with words
Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor
Brother, homie, love, a friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, f*ck that low shit
I'm on some more 'everybody-should-know' shit
Or let's be real discreet
Everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate (ay)
When was the last time her and a man was straight? (ay)
Just chill, light bulbs dim (ay)
You are my adult film

Life begins right now
Life begins right now (My adult film)

The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
You start to get comfortable after you get it right
Yeah, you start to get comfortable after you get it right

Misogynistic monologue what we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest, and higher North
But below the waist, I'm a dog
Your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name with a diamond cross
But you a strong, stand-tall soldier
They lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me
Feel your good vibes layin' on me
When them light bulbs dim
Lemme watch you, my adult film

Life begins right now

Parasites try to steal a coach (true)
While chem trails and satellites hover over

Have you sitting up north (facts)
Study the law (word)
Get your appeal (true)
Soon you back on the street the shit'd get real (facts)
They try to kill us off since the days of the brilliant Moors
May they ships pull up to the Sicilian shores
So I hustle more, ain't no justice for the poor
Got me feeling like middle fingers up, f*ck the law
Bust a Dutchie open, liquor pour

Christ nigga to Allah nigga (Alḥamdulillāh)
Then I evolved, nigga (yes)
No religions, my commandments are my standards (word)
A stand up man, no clowning, no snitching
Got a bid, I'm sitting down
Do the time, call it paying taxes
Living with my actions (word), corners to the grave
Yeah, I'm on that wave
Yeah, I fornicate with fly bitches, horny ways
Just the way I was taught though (uh)
Can't tell if this is reality or just another award show?
These women be lost, so beautiful, so smart (word)
But why can't we be heavenly? Don't think to use your heart (yo' heart)
'Cause we could be so great, pray it's not too late
Put pride aside, coincide, I bet we both be straight
Straight to the top, side to side, twin Rolls Royces
We made choices to be devoted (uh)
To go at those foes who come at us with upside down crosses

The war is against love, I ain't trusting that (trusting that, uh, uh)

Fire spitter, I ain't never met a higher nigga
Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless
Mansion, marble foyer
I can afford a closet in alphabet order
A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega
British Knights sneaker, my C so ill
That man I get chills when I look at my Christian Dior's, they kill
D is for Dries Van Noten
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
D cups, tequila and blunts
Weed, women, and liquor
Depending on the day is a different mission
They not knowing, they wanna know what he got on
The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up on
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of G, the Gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it
.44s never could miss him, coming to see us
Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
We blowing trees, tell me don't it feel good, nigga

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we here together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
F*ck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who's clapping
Night boo
What I eat him, he like food
Pulled out the barrel
4-5ths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt
While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter
Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack I'm faceless like an iron mask
They get away quick traceless, lying back, liars pass
I breathe deep like Lamaze class
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we here together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Look I don't have that much time, candidly I'm in divorce
Rumors, DUIs, in and out of court
Different judges, assault charges hovers on your boy
Other niggas' wives lust to be under covers with your boy
Y'all don't want an angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO man
I'm only 36 but if it's p-point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude
Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artiste on the masters controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product'll be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef
I used to open to making fifty G's
But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze
My larynx'll serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la



 

Patient, my fate is highly favored by the father, love to all
Rest in peace to Zah Noo the barber brought cases
Celebrate and take it back to thought
The real New York
Death to rapists and rats, the touch school to Brooklyn stories
The king is the life to lord and queens
All the stories of Puerto Rican righteous I heard things
Know some people who know some people
Getting money, broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who lives where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect
Where I'm from, it's never over if
Somebody dies, somebody gon' ride
Years later, somebody sons double 4-5
You laid up in ICU, hoping you survive
Too many stories like this one

What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?

Uh, yeah
Somewhat caricatures, Amateur Boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of swords
Bandages on, my finger still are managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind and still I hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze dripping
In fear of God, scented in antique fragrance
Some nights Cree, flavors
I am motivation, I don't talk with the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, no matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson
Project apartment parties, rest in peace to Marley
Try not to get booked by Officer Lavarti

What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?


 

At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fighting Italian rival gangs, they was sniffing glue
I was skipping school, smoking green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody's team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hopping and snatching jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in waves
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the night calling, them Benz' engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pouring and niggas balling
I put the 22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying
You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying

Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from? This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? Who laced it?
Previous night memories who erased it? Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, loner the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talking 'bout it
Singing me praises, I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screaming out Q Vietnam the loudest
"Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team"
So that explains the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, my nigga, Q-U shit
Audemar watch, burner piece, switch, new whip
Stoli vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying
You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying



 

Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles who make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends
B.I.G. shit
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

Stop waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
"What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out"
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
The world's at war, the shit never ends
Everybody packin'
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
What will it take to end?

Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'
Niggas should stop lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in'
Cars, you just started drivin'
I've been ridin', been made it
You and your pretend stages
I did this since windbreakers (Windbreakers)


 

Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain't got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say "I ain't no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Here's my help I'm tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this, now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn I'm speedin'

Now girl, you mean the world to me

I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in

Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, that's 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it's a setback
I don't respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I'm laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you
(Same to you, same to you)

Oh oh



 

Talking to this cutie on facetime
Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility, critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized?, why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the mob represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Ya enemy done
What's eternal?
A disease that needs a vaccination, plagues, black season
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
QueensBridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early 80's, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marly was changing hip-hop
Then Marly and Shanté caught a body, UTFO
She cold, "Roxanne's Revenge", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the QU
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's QueensBridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shout out to Havoc, shout out to Pone
Shout out to Jungle
Shout out to Jeff
Shout out to Big Lord
The big dog (Lord)
Free Bar, Spark (Bar, Spark)
It's a lot going on
Free the kings
It's a lot going on man, it's heavy
Goodfellas man
Prodigy man
It's heavy man
We need to lighten it up
To all ya
My bros



 

Peace y'all, yeah
This one right here, goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal ones
You for me and me for you
We see things alike
We live alike, in truth

The craziest things already happened, get me
Could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame, yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
Tell you lames something, spit some game
Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?
When you place blame, then you're defective
When you take blame, then you're respected
You gotta give me credit

Woah
Life is good, I must admit it
Woah
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah
Life is good, it's good, it's good

Uh
The craziest things just happened to me, get me
So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hilltops
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life

Woah
Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah)
Woah (Beautiful life)
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah (Life's still good)
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah (Yeah, yeah)
Life is good, it's good, it's good

A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
I could nail it, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live, and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world
Night, destiny
Life is good



I'm oblivious to you skeptics
What you hear you ain't ever hear 'til I repped it
Iridescent heroes essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message, air 'em out
Heard some people discussing my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move in style, wild, exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
"Oochie Wally" ideas
Sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed
Signed to Columbia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging about your past and
Thinking back on trips on Manhattan
Dad was rolling hotels like the plaza
Black bellhops holding
Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Just try to be the best you, man
That's all I can say, man)
No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Don't light over here, man
Put that away, man, put that away)
No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Tryna tell 'em, know what I'm saying?
Big Apple my Hennessy, please)
No bad energy please, no bad energy

To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirt, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper
Still miss Big Poppa

No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy




Yeah
Yeah

Literally rich, this Nas, sick
Still woulda hit a enemy with a TEC in nine-six
Exotic material on the neck and fly whips
I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to death
Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you with real millionaire shit
Escargot, my car fresh from the dealership
Esco alias, my escrow grow daily
It's the freshest Air Max wearer, yes
Ejaculatory depression after sex
And that mean after I nut, don't touch me, no questions
Unless she's a restless spirit then I can heal it
Spend a lot of time together, I know her feelings
But you fightin' what the essence of a woman is
I respect you, my love's limitless
But what are you becoming?
You wanna be the man or the woman? Play your position
Mornin' or night I'm lickin' the pudding ain't I?
Since my days of St. Ides
Pullin' out box cutters to bang opps who ain't us
To Bentley Continentals, see the man I is
Hand-to-hand hustlers always claiming they ran The Brizz
The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son
But if I was in the Juice Crew, we woulda won
No disrespect 'less disrespect served to me
You a gangsta groupie, gassin' niggas to murder me, nigga?
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
And that's word to Yammy, yeah
Deep roots, I ain't have to fake it yet
Old solid tree branches ain't breakin' yet
A vet

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

I got the je ne sais quoi, why bother
With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't by cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon, still
And that's word to Will, for real

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

Shout to Draws, Spanky, Black Ed, Hands
Shout to Shabazz, Wewop and Harvey
Rest in glory
TJ Killa Black, rest in glory
Shout to all the young legends we losin' too soon
Yeah






Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily

 
Everybody's not gon' get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
'Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

 
Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Here's the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday

 
Had a lot of losses
It hurt a lot losing cats but it was worth it
I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat 'cause I'm black and I'm ill
And I'm real and made millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it
I don't internalize it, I ignore it
I was taught to observe it
Not absorb it, so I don't absorb it

[Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

 
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling

 
Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 arena
You made it then it's crazy and now you gotta rock stadiums
I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front
Then the shade come, they try to say that your day is done

[Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

[Al Jarreau]
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody
Married to harmony

In our younger days we were so in love
And the thought of losing you was enough
Can't lose me

Who be the holy prophet, they watchin' with all his posture?
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest, he gots to
Be from the '80s era
His tint is shade Carrera, Queens forever
Green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted-in rappers you go against me
You can't tantalize a call girl with just a roll of pennies
Can't bait a lion in ya trap without a tranquilizer
You enterin' a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like Avatar
Caviar black diamonds, can you imagine, y'all?
Takin' from a rich man plate, kick in his door
'Cause his war with the bloodsuckers of the poor
The first shall be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jouët pours, like this

Uh
I tell a story of a prince life and all his glory
It's killin' me softly
Somber like the buildings at Fort Green
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me, is this thing on?
Test, one, two, gimme some feedback if y'all could feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin' dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin' wit' ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up the sister
Lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin' up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and roadblocks
Police barricades, batterrams
Doors off the hinges, wake up flinchin', who ratted, man?
Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housin' added in
Every department searchin' your apartment
Ramsackin' it, found four ratchets
DEA jack us, we gotta escape the madness
Haha, yeah, escape the madness
Yeah, through the eyes of Pablo
That's how I'm lookin' at you, as an obstacle and everything
It's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dinin'
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for ridin'
Ties was suppliers for my days of the projects
Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the ambitions of a rider
Pretty amazon on my arm, nigga, I'm the flyest
The flyest, haha, yeah

Lemme hear that



Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

She edu-ma-cated, she said she related to the Asian
Ethic persuasion, the sex is amazin'
Never bought her a Birkin, my night-time nurse
Maybe more like a surgeon, nice on the eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block that I would service
Said, "It's straight," we need a place up in Jamaica estates
And she was like, "Oh no" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, not be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evel Knievel, on the soul cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a Czar
Now she hit the town with the legal Escobar, she's my

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

We fresh outta the Met Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best-dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes, no trespassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids, but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost, back in the crib, some avocado toast
Laid-back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin', startin' to think about children
And bringin' 'em in the world with Kim Jung illin'
But since I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willin', she's willin', we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are, in this Western Civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his whole party

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (yo)

Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

January 28, 1968
Born into this world as William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch Long Island
Scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with

Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This
'87 dropped a classic disc

The facts is the tracklist was like four
The vocals, the beats -- according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative

This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
'Cause Clarence 13 next had New York on lock

Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearin' Kurtis Blow saying
"It can't get better than this"
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits

From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre

Supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap
Forte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn

With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote "Smack me and I smack you back"

Sounded like the answer to the "I Ain't No Joke" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzin' from Wyndanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddie Foxx

Totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son

A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, some was watchin' him, mesmorized
Respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

[Nas talking]
"Unauthorized biography of Rakim. Epilogue: Mother was
A jazz singer. Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let
The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique. That's

The end of the group. Went off to solo. 
Dropped the R, then the 18th Letter, and I think, somethin', 
The Master. Was signed to Aftermath, scheduled to release
An album "Oh My God" with Dr. Dre. The album was

Dismantled because of creative differences. Thee end
To the new beginning. Yeah. Next book, KRS-One. Peace."








 

R-A-W

You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cookbook, you gossipin', watchin' hip-hop & love, uh

I don't mean to be brass, even a genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends, they don't mess with rappers, correction

Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor
Brother, homie, love, a friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, f*ck that low shit
I'm on some more 'everybody-should-know' shit
Or let's be real discreet
Everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate (ay)
When was the last time her and a man was straight? (ay)

You start to get comfortable after you get it right
Yeah, you start to get comfortable after you get it right

Misogynistic monologue what we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest, and higher North
But below the waist, I'm a dog
Your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name with a diamond cross
But you a strong, stand-tall soldier
They lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me
Feel your good vibes layin' on me
When them light bulbs dim
Lemme watch you, my adult film

Whassup African
Whassup African

Yo the Haiti, Barbados, Bahamas, Grenada

From New York to Botswana, London to Guyana

Parasites try to steal a coach (true)
While chem trails and satellites hover over
Feds is watching real niggas ask this is so (ask this is so)

For these lawyers who be ripping soldiers off in court
They didn't get em all, they just take your money a lot
Have you sitting up north (facts)
Study the law (word)
Get your appeal (true)
Soon you back on the street the shit'd get real (facts)
They try to kill us off since the days of the brilliant Moors
May they ships pull up to the Sicilian shores
So I hustle more, ain't no justice for the poor
Got me feeling like middle fingers up, f*ck the law
Bust a Dutchie open, liquor pour

Chicago yo, you know Chicago y'all know
The war is against love, we under attack (yeah)

Yo the war is against love, who's busting back? (Me)

I went from, semi bummy nigga to money nigga (ha)
Bike nigga to car nigga
Christ nigga to Allah nigga (Alḥamdulillāh)
Then I evolved, nigga (yes)
No religions, my commandments are my standards (word)
A stand up man, no clowning, no snitching
Got a bid, I'm sitting down
Do the time, call it paying taxes
Living with my actions (word), corners to the grave
Yeah, I'm on that wave
Yeah, I fornicate with fly bitches, horny ways
Just the way I was taught though (uh)
Can't tell if this is reality or just another award show?
These women be lost, so beautiful, so smart (word)
But why can't we be heavenly? Don't think to use your heart (yo' heart)
'Cause we could be so great, pray it's not too late
Put pride aside, coincide, I bet we both be straight
Straight to the  , side to side, twin Rolls Royces
We made choices to be devoted (uh)
To go at those foes who come at us with upside down crosses

The war is against love, I ain't trusting that (trusting that, uh, uh)
The war is against love, who's busting back? (Me, me, me, uh)
To all the 50 states, all across the map (the whole world too)

The war is against love, how will you react, to that?

Yeah, tell you how I'm reacting
I'm strapped and ready, go all the way
The war is against peace
The war is against love
Yeah, know that


Fire spitter, I ain't never met a higher nigga
Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless
Mansion, marble foyer
I can afford a closet in alphabet order
A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega
British Knights sneaker, my C so ill
That man I get chills when I look at my Christian Dior's, they kill
D is for Dries Van Noten
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
D cups, tequila and blunts
Weed, women, and liquor
Depending on the day is a different mission
They not knowing, they wanna know what he got on
The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up on
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of G, the Gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it
.44s never could miss him, coming to see us
Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
We blowing trees, tell me don't it feel good, nigga

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we here together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
F*ck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who's clapping
Night boo
What I eat him, he like food
Pulled out the barrel
4-5ths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt
While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter
Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack I'm faceless like an iron mask
They get away quick traceless, lying back, liars pass
I breathe deep like Lamaze class
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we here together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Look I don't have that much time, candidly I'm in divorce
Rumors, DUIs, in and out of court
Different judges, assault charges hovers on your boy
Other niggas' wives lust to be under covers with your boy
Y'all don't want an angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO man
I'm only 36 but if it's p-point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude
Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artiste on the masters controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product'll be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef
I used to open to making fifty G's
But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze
My larynx'll serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Patient, my fate is highly favored by the father, love to all
Rest in peace to Zah Noo the barber brought cases
Celebrate and take it back to thought
The real New York
Death to rapists and rats, the touch school to Brooklyn stories
The king is the life to lord and queens
All the stories of Puerto Rican righteous I heard things
Know some people who know some people
Getting money, broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who lives where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect
Where I'm from, it's never over if
Somebody dies, somebody gon' ride
Years later, somebody sons double 4-5
You laid up in ICU, hoping you survive
Too many stories like this one

What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?

Uh, yeah
Somewhat caricatures, Amateur Boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of swords
Bandages on, my finger still are managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind and still I hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze dripping
In fear of God, scented in antique fragrance
Some nights Cree, flavors
I am motivation, I don't talk with the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, no matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson
Project apartment parties, rest in peace to Marley
Try not to get booked by Officer Lavarti

What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?



At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fighting Italian rival gangs, they was sniffing glue
I was skipping school, smoking green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody's team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hopping and snatching jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in waves
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the night calling, them Benz' engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pouring and niggas balling
I put the 22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying
You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying

Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from? This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? Who laced it?
Previous night memories who erased it? Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, loner the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talking 'bout it
Singing me praises, I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screaming out Q Vietnam the loudest
"Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team"
So that explains the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, my nigga, Q-U shit
Audemar watch, burner piece, switch, new whip
Stoli vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying
You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying



Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles who make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends
B.I.G. shit
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

S  waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
"What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out"
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
The world's at war, the shit never ends
Everybody packin'
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
What will it take to end?

Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'
Niggas should s  lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in'
Cars, you just started drivin'
I've been ridin', been made it
You and your pretend stages
I did this since windbreakers (Windbreakers)



Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain't got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say "I ain't no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Here's my help I'm tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this, now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn I'm speedin'

Now girl, you mean the world to me

I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in

Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, that's 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it's a setback
I don't respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I'm laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you
(Same to you, same to you)

Oh oh

Talking to this cutie on facetime
Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility, critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized?, why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the mob represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Ya enemy done
What's eternal?
A disease that needs a vaccination, plagues, black season
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
QueensBridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early 80's, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marly was changing hip-hop
Then Marly and Shanté caught a body, UTFO
She cold, "Roxanne's Revenge", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the QU
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's QueensBridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shout out to Havoc, shout out to Pone
Shout out to Jungle
Shout out to Jeff
Shout out to Big Lord
The big dog (Lord)
Free Bar, Spark (Bar, Spark)
It's a lot going on
Free the kings
It's a lot going on man, it's heavy
Goodfellas man
Prodigy man
It's heavy man
We need to lighten it up
To all ya
My bros


Peace y'all, yeah
This one right here, goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal ones
You for me and me for you
We see things alike
We live alike, in truth

The craziest things already happened, get me
Could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame, yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
Tell you lames something, spit some game
Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?
When you place blame, then you're defective
When you take blame, then you're respected
You gotta give me credit

Woah
Life is good, I must admit it
Woah
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah
Life is good, it's good, it's good

Uh
The craziest things just happened to me, get me
So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hill s
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life

Woah
Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah)
Woah (Beautiful life)
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah (Life's still good)
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah (Yeah, yeah)
Life is good, it's good, it's good

A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
I could nail it, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live, and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world
Night, destiny
Life is good




I'm oblivious to you skeptics
What you hear you ain't ever hear 'til I repped it
Iridescent heroes essence, please clear the exits
I chase demons outdoors, force 'em to hear the message, air 'em out
Heard some people discussing my whereabouts
Yeah, it's been a few sightings of me, a fair amount
Never seen much, but yet I'm never in the house
Move in style, wild, exciting when I do step out
Y'all been rhyming for years and Jungle made a hit
"Oochie Wally" ideas
Sold a million records
Had 'em embarrassed
Signed to Columbia
Blew a check, he was laughing
While y'all in the studio bragging about your past and
Thinking back on trips on Manhattan
Dad was rolling hotels like the plaza
Black bellhops holding
Rich people bags, tip their hats to old men coming out of cabs
Limousine holding doors for them
We all got a job to do, go for it

No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Just try to be the best you, man
That's all I can say, man)
No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Don't light over here, man
Put that away, man, put that away)
No bad energy please, no bad energy
(Tryna tell 'em, know what I'm saying?
Big Apple my Hennessy, please)
No bad energy please, no bad energy

To rappers who never sold crack, telling other people's lives
Never shot nobody but be shooting people in their rhymes
Never robbed nobody or re-upped with coke in they ride
I'm probably who they talking about when they're writing most of their lines
And I ain't notice it
Trapping was what was happening with bolder cliques
Around me I'm surrounded by the most devoted clique
We saw the smokers get rowdy for all the potentness
And still ain't know how sick it was in that ocean abyss
What doesn't come out in the wash comes out in the rinse
You suckers ain't had no say so
Whoever put you in the position to have a say so should be questioned theyself
I'm silk shirt, summer time sunny, sun chaser
Pretty girl tongue taster, southern girl luster
City girl love maker
The matinee watcher
The good weather on a Saturday afternoon shopper
Good gift copper
Still miss Big Poppa

No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy
No bad energy please, no bad energy


Yeah
Yeah

Literally rich, this Nas, sick
Still woulda hit a enemy with a TEC in nine-six
Exotic material on the neck and fly whips
I was fresh out the 'jects, decked out to death
Y'all witnessed it, I could fill you with real millionaire shit
Escargot, my car fresh from the dealership
Esco alias, my escrow grow daily
It's the freshest Air Max wearer, yes
Ejaculatory depression after sex
And that mean after I nut, don't touch me, no questions
Unless she's a restless spirit then I can heal it
Spend a lot of time together, I know her feelings
But you fightin' what the essence of a woman is
I respect you, my love's limitless
But what are you becoming?
You wanna be the man or the woman? Play your position
Mornin' or night I'm lickin' the pudding ain't I?
Since my days of St. Ides
Pullin' out box cutters to bang opps who ain't us
To Bentley Continentals, see the man I is
Hand-to-hand hustlers always claiming they ran The Brizz
The big homies don't approve that
Felt and Dirty Red fundin' RK but where was you at?
We all tried to move crack
Nowadays I'm just showing my age
The new goons hardly heard of these legendary names, it's strange
The Bridge rappers influenced me, son
But if I was in the Juice Crew, we woulda won
No disrespect 'less disrespect served to me
You a gangsta groupie, gassin' niggas to murder me, nigga?
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
And that's word to Yammy, yeah
Deep roots, I ain't have to fake it yet
Old solid tree branches ain't breakin' yet
A vet

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

I got the je ne sais quoi, why bother
With girls who like to play keep-away with they toddlers?
She started with good intentions like a rich pastor
Bitch was bad, turned from good thing to disaster
Takes forever to build a rep, one second to lose it
She put her neck in a noose, snapped it
Hangin' on every word she heard come outta cougar mouth, super foul
Play your cards right, deuces wild, salute my pals
Fathers all around the board goin' through it
She got lobster appetites, lots of habits
Like frontin' when she need apartment deposits
Here's something, get you a starter
But pardon my pimpin', I don't sponsor
I don't by cars, I coach you to win, know what?
If you broke and your man don't teach you, get rid of him
Who I'm reppin'? 10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon, still
And that's word to Will, for real

Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family
Get rich project niggas
Billionaire mindset niggas
Know you know my set, niggas
10th Street, 12th Street, Vernon Family

Shout to Draws, Spanky, Black Ed, Hands
Shout to Shabazz, Wewop and Harvey
Rest in glory
TJ Killa Black, rest in glory
Shout to all the young legends we losin' too soon
Yeah

Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily

 
Everybody's not gon' get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
'Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

 
Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Here's the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday

 
Had a lot of losses
It hurt a lot losing cats but it was worth it
I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat 'cause I'm black and I'm ill
And I'm real and made millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it
I don't internalize it, I ignore it
I was taught to observe it
Not absorb it, so I don't absorb it

Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

 
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling

 
Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 arena
You made it then it's crazy and now you gotta rock stadiums
I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front
Then the shade come, they try to say that your day is done


Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody, memory, melody
Melody, memory, harmony, steadily
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same




In our younger days we were so in love
And the thought of losing you was enough
Can't lose me

Who be the holy prophet, they watchin' with all his posture?
His Rothstein goggle game be the dopest, he gots to
Be from the '80s era
His tint is shade Carrera, Queens forever
Green pipe seats, clean Panamera
Amateur Hanna-Barbera characters know they envy
The illest Hennessy Black sipper with loaded semis
You pick of the week, voted-in rappers you go against me
You can't tantalize a call girl with just a roll of pennies
Can't bait a lion in ya trap without a tranquilizer
You enterin' a boxing ring with no trainer beside ya
My Panerai watch glows like Avatar
Caviar black diamonds, can you imagine, y'all?
Takin' from a rich man plate, kick in his door
'Cause his war with the bloodsuckers of the poor
The first shall be last, that's just universal law
Pop the cork, the Perrier-Jouët pours, like this

Uh
I tell a story of a prince life and all his glory
It's killin' me softly
Somber like the buildings at Fort Green
Hood monsters and niggas who walk mean
Hood niggas and they just came home and they grip they chrome
Can you hear me, is this thing on?
Test, one, two, gimme some feedback if y'all could feel it
For the home invasion dudes that be robbin' dealers
Picture me runnin' inside they crib, rollin' wit' ya
Mask on the face, tyin' up the sister
Lookin' for the bricks to get richer
Smackin' up the dude with the gun, take the jewels and the funds
A dirty game when you servin' 'caine
Got feds to watch, hoes to watch, checkpoints and roadblocks
Police barricades, batterrams
Doors off the hinges, wake up flinchin', who ratted, man?
Knew who it had to been, states, feds and housin' added in
Every department searchin' your apartment
Ramsackin' it, found four ratchets
DEA jack us, we gotta escape the madness
Haha, yeah, escape the madness
Yeah, through the eyes of Pablo
That's how I'm lookin' at you, as an obstacle and everything
It's all natural, I'm keepin' it pilin'
Keepin' heat with the silencers
Learnin' Greek and Italian, speak with kings while dinin'
Good with hyenas, meanin' it's hood when it's time for ridin'
Ties was suppliers for my days of the projects
Where I resided, a phenomenon
With the ambitions of a rider
Pretty amazon on my arm, nigga, I'm the flyest
The flyest, haha, yeah

Lemme hear that


Tanasia, Tanasia
If you not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

Truck jewels, big stacks, mustard boots
Construction on her feet, she eat duck confit
I shoot up the club whenever I hit it raw
If she have a baby by me, I'ma love her more
Brings food to the crib when I'm laying low
And she know how to roll weed, but don't smoke
Chinese massages, wifey, no side-chick
Go sight-seeing with the god
Playing cards with my dad, frying chicken for the mob
Simply Lemonade, raspberry for the wash, gosh
She know who tryin' to rock her to sleep to get to me
Give 'em the side eye when she see 'em in the street
Her brother locked up, he doin' ten up in the beast
He's short, he comin' home and she hyped for his release
Fly her to Hollywood, watch flicks from Nollywood
Like hydraulics, she ride the wood

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

She edu-ma-cated, she said she related to the Asian
Ethic persuasion, the sex is amazin'
Never bought her a Birkin, my night-time nurse
Maybe more like a surgeon, nice on the eyes, I put that work in
Back when she was on the same block that I would service
Said, "It's straight," we need a place up in Jamaica estates
And she was like, "Oh no" in a silky Kimono
Said the streets, the snakes, plus Governor Cuomo
Flashes out the window, people takin' my photo
She knew I wasn't gon' be no husband, not be a no-show
Leave her standin' at the altar, bro, I couldn't falter
Plus that Nigerian blood mixed in her culture
Body like she Evel Knievel, on the soul cycle
Lookin' like Janet, dance like Michael
She knew I wasn't cut from the cloth to be a Czar
Now she hit the town with the legal Escobar, she's my

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor

We fresh outta the Met Gala, express power
Exude the essence of best-dressed for the next hour
Toast glasses, velvet ropes, no trespassin'
Hella smoke, our section has the best fashion
Picture us laughin', how ticklish the money has us
Like little kids, but the difference is we'd much rather
Be ghost, back in the crib, some avocado toast
Laid-back, we choose that over Amalfi Coast
Chillin', startin' to think about children
And bringin' 'em in the world with Kim Jung illin'
But since I'm feelin' what I'm feelin' and she feelin' what she feelin'
I'm willin', she's willin', we buildin'
Every man originated in Asia
One continent, Africa was a part of Asia
Here we are, in this Western Civilization
I believe that we was destined to make it

Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor
Tanasia, Tanasia
If you're not from Queensbridge, then you must be from Asia
Never knew a love like this before, who said you was just a whore?
Where you walk, love, I kiss the floor








 
 

Royalty




Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

A known fraud once fell on his own sword
Scrawny as a fiend, he'll tell on his own broad
His lady's crazy and it bugs me
Behind her best friend back, she call her best friend baby ugly
Less then a week ago
He's beatin' his dick to a freak he know
Talkin' dirty to him on speakerphone
Right before he clinked up, his girl creeped up
Swung a knife, hit his cheekbone, made a deep cut
He holdin' his face, he out the door
She yellin' out the window, "You can stay with that whore"
Hours went past, stitched up with the gauze
Gettin' drunk by the store, smokin' blunts with some more
Fraud ass niggas who like to front and big talk
Never swung at nobody, never let a gun spark
Big nine-seven Benz with the old body
Pulls up to the corner, out jumps his whole party

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty (nigga)
But they gon' know when they see us (yo)

Football wives, basketball wives
Mistresses slash more tires with knives
They lookin' for a dollar
I'm lookin' for a JoAnne Chesimard to turn to a shotta
Spot a King of Diamonds, onyx, one bitch get it off the floor
Other chick out of her man's pockets
What kind of shows you be watchin'?
It shows, this is how we choose who we should rock with
I think about settlin' down again, have more seeds
Ten toes on the ground again, let hoes be
Nothin' like makin' love with somebody you love
Nothin' like comin' home to grub
Netflix, hugs with a wet kiss
The best shit, take my mind off of makin' records
I need that moral support
Give me a reason to spoil you more
Make 'em jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us

Tryna get my niggas legitimate
Shit is ugly, my dudes strugglin', drug dealer shit
Silhouette of a murderer, thug nigga, fitted Mets cap
Drunk liquor bit, young black militant
Just hopin' I hit a lick, a criminal's wit
Intelligence, still a menace each Guinness I sip
Bring the kid ideas, the visions I get
How this dude rich? He snuck in with no citizenship
Motivation, so I get off my ass
I'm the star of the movie, lookin' for my supportin' cast
Read the Forbes pages, lookin' at G4s
Wish it could be more, pray I beat the court cases
Women with small waists, lonely, I ain't too far
Smoke weed, and count paper
I'm about paper and pussy and buyin' the bar
Fly ass niggas, y'all jealous of who we are

Whatever you do, young king, don't wind up dead (wind up dead)
Young queen, cross your legs (cross your legs)
Put a crown on your head and remove the chains
Even diamond chains are for slaves
Don't step foot in no penitentiary (penitentiary), oh
Don't taste the poison (poison)
No, don't you bail on your family (no), no-no-no-no-no, no
'Cause they don't know you're royalty
But they gon' know when they see us



The unauthorized copy. Dedication to my children, my child
Destiny Jones. To my niece and nephews, Suree, Malik, Jabari.
The world is yours. Acknowledgements: First off, I wanna
Thank God. And I wanna thank everybody for helping me out
With this. Couldn't do it without you. Chapter 1.

c
January 28, 1968
Born into this world as William Griffin The Great
Chapter 1, Wyandanch Long Island
Scientific rhymin' invented a new sound when he met with

Eric Barrier from East Elmhurst
The melody they created was the first
Burst on the scene, 1986 with Clap To This
'87 dropped a classic disc

The facts is the tracklist was like four
The vocals, the beats -- according to Marley Marl
Recorded in my hometown Queensbridge
That's why it's so relative

This biography was unauthorized
I spit it how it was given to author Nas
William changed his name at sixteen to Rakim Allah
'Cause Clarence 13 next had New York on lock

Gods on every block, jams in every park
I remember hearin' Kurtis Blow saying
"It can't get better than this"
'Til Run DMC blew my brains to bits

From leather coats to shell toes to the Stan smiths, to Dapper Dan kicks
First million-dollar deal ever in rap, 18th Letter did that
From 4th & Broadway to Uni to MCA
We followed the leader to Harlem's Apollo Theatre

Supreme rapped and the 50 that don't rap
Forte Green, Queens, Long Island wolfpack
Paid In Full posse, hot they was on
And Ra had his firstborn

With the next line I'ma be easy
His wisdom's name is Fifi
EPMD put a record out, was dope
Tension spread, and I quote "Smack me and I smack you back"

Sounded like the answer to the "I Ain't No Joke" track
For a second it ain't look good
Little tension buzzin' from Wyndanch to Brentwood
Misunderstood, all forgot by sixteen when I met Freddie Foxx

Totin' burners, the whole coast's most concern was
How was Rakim's flow, made Christians convert with Islamic ways
Let The Rhythm Hit 'Em was the third LP
A sophisticated mean one, before similar voices were King Son

A few others, but sooner or later, the game was Ra's kingdom
At sixteen, some was watchin' him, mesmorized
Respect, not jockin' him, was so amazin', besides
He came on the stage with lasers in his eyes
Walk with me now

[Nas talking]
"Unauthorized biography of Rakim. Epilogue: Mother was
A jazz singer. Nephew to R & B legend Ruth Brown
Discography: Paid In Full, Follow The Leader, Let
The Rhythm Hit 'Em, Don't Sweat The Technique. That's

The end of the group. Went off to solo. 
Dropped the R, then the 18th Letter, and I think, somethin', 
The Master. Was signed to Aftermath, scheduled to release
An album "Oh My God" with Dr. Dre. The album was

Dismantled because of creative differences. Thee end
To the new beginning. Yeah. Next book, KRS-One. Peace."


R-A-W
R-A-W

F*ck outta here, second guessin' our love
Dick Tracy, detective, inspectin' hoes need a hug
You need to detect this dick, get your ass out the club
Get a cookbook, you gossipin', watchin' hip-hop & love, uh

I don't mean to be brass, even a genius asks questions in class
Supposed to know a love that'll last
Her friends, they don't mess with rappers, correction
I'm Akhenaten, King Tut's predecessor
I fantasize, and no mind him, I'm slick with words
Tell your girlfriend I flip the birds
She don't know shit, I am your neighbor
Brother, homie, love, a friend to smoke with
I want us to take road trips, f*ck that low shit
I'm on some more 'everybody-should-know' shit
Or let's be real discreet
Everybody lies, not everybody Nas
So your friend might hate (ay)
When was the last time her and a man was straight? (ay)
Just chill, light bulbs dim (ay)
You are my adult film

The end of your comfort zone is the start of your life
You start to get comfortable after you get it right
Yeah, you start to get comfortable after you get it right

Misogynistic monologue what we dialogue
Yeah, I'm mature from the chest, and higher North
But below the waist, I'm a dog
Your girl in heat like cayenne sauce
She so sweet, but she kinda lost
Like me, African name with a diamond cross
But you a strong, stand-tall soldier
They lean on you, expecting you not to fall over
Like you never feel pressure, like you made of steel
So I absorb your pain, I like to see you chill
Eight millimeter cinematic celluloid
I see us both, little girl, little boy
Explorin' the world, similar, virgins became experienced
We both like it in front of mirrors, and this shit start weighin' on me
Feel your good vibes layin' on me
When them light bulbs dim
Lemme watch you, my adult film

Life begins right now

The Art of It




Fire spitter, I ain't never met a higher nigga
Me extinguished is like Queensbridge fiendless

A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega
British Knights sneaker, my C so ill
That man I get chills when I look at my Christian Dior's, they kill
D is for Dries Van Noten
Young niggas try to keep up with what I'm doing
D cups, tequila and blunts
Weed, women, and liquor
Depending on the day is a different mission
They not knowing, they wanna know what he got on
The QB Don went and got his Pete Rock on
Nas keep a fine bitch to roll his weed up on
My niggas in Mount Vernon keep it G'd up for him
Speaking of G, the Gat I'm good with it, hit your hood with it

Glad to see you made it home to the hood, nigga
We blowing trees, tell me don't it feel good, nigga

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we here together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Another bullet manufactured, another man in his casket
F*ck maintaining, that's lame language
Dust to dust, ashes to ashes, I duck quick
Seen fire flashes, the type of fire that spit out a magnum
And I'm the type who runs to the drama looking for who's clapping
Night boo
What I eat him, he like food
Pulled out the barrel
4-5ths rip through bone marrow
Make his toes spiral the dirt
While his feet kick up rock, he's a sprinter
Police agenda, lock up niggas for three winters
When I attack I'm faceless like an iron mask
They get away quick traceless, lying back, liars pass
I breathe deep like Lamaze class
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last
Stretched out or in a body bag, I ain't that
Live young, obtain wisdom, and die last

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we here together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la

Look I don't have that much time, candidly I'm in divorce
Rumors, DUIs, in and out of court
Different judges, assault charges hovers on your boy
Other niggas' wives lust to be under covers with your boy
Y'all don't want an angry Nas on your label
Y'all got plenty checks, CEO man
I'm only 36 but if it's p-point five on the table
I say with all respect my dude
Thank you, we had the best times but I'm about respect, I'm about the talent I possess
Never know, there could just be a time when I'm behind your desk then let you go
Could you imagine Nas the exec?
The artiste on the masters controlling your release
Probably they wanna wait 'til I'm deceased to honor me
So my product'll be a big commodity
Not bothered if my son and daughter eat off of me
Cautiously I write this next line honestly 'cause I'm a G, there's no beef
I used to open to making fifty G's
But now I spend that on a diamond to make her neck freeze
My larynx'll serenade the hood
I tell the cops my blood dirty, they say I'm all good
TMZ, they hoping when the marriage end I'ma turn to Larry Flynt
Nas is not the average gent, I'm on my classy shit
Here's one small percent of what y'all in store to get
More real nigga shit

Damn it feels good, it feels good don't it
La-la-la
Put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la
Niggas in the hood don't live forever (my G niggas)
As long as we together (my QB niggas)
We gon' put that good shit in the air (yeah)
La-la-la








 
 

Highly Favored




Patient, my fate is highly favored by the father, love to all
Rest in peace to Zah Noo the barber brought cases
Celebrate and take it back to thought
The real New York
Death to rapists and rats, the touch school to Brooklyn stories
The king is the life to lord and queens
All the stories of Puerto Rican righteous I heard things
Know some people who know some people
Getting money, broke people claim you owe some people
It's easy to explain anything to a real liver of life
Who lives where you live and see shit the same
Gotta watch who you joke or get checked
We easily mistake jokes for disrespect
Where I'm from, it's never over if
Somebody dies, somebody gon' ride
Years later, somebody sons double 4-5
You laid up in ICU, hoping you survive
Too many stories like this one

What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?

Uh, yeah
Somewhat caricatures, Amateur Boys
I'm like a classic pianist with a handful of swords
Bandages on, my finger still are managing chords
Like a live band, performing in a sand storm
Blind and still I hit the right keys
Swift as a life breeze dripping
In fear of God, scented in antique fragrance
Some nights Cree, flavors
I am motivation, I don't talk with the next man, I am never hating
This daily bread, holy bread
Alphabetical numerals, codes of red
What's more dense, gold or lead?
What's more expensive?
The OG said, no matter what it is, rent it
And never buy it, it's all temporary possessions
We don't own nothing on this Earth but our soul and that's the lesson
Project apartment parties, rest in peace to Marley
Try not to get booked by Officer Lavarti

What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
Patience
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to y'all (Peace to y'all, yeah)
What's shaking?
My fate is highly favored by the father, peace to all (Peace to all, yeah)
What's shaking?
What's shaking?








 
 

Queens Wolf




At fourteen tried out for the ball team
Junior high, they denied me
I shot bricks that made the backboard scream
Fighting Italian rival gangs, they was sniffing glue
I was skipping school, smoking green, that was the shit to do
Stole somebody's team jacket at practice, slept through my classes
The borough Queens, so it's rep the Q to the casket
Average student, had illusions of the supernatural
Horror movie addict, werewolf fanatic and Dracul'
One night after school and train hopping and snatching jewels
I dozed at midnight, woke up a little after two
My hands shook violently
My eyes took red
My hair spun in waves
Bread was the only word I said
I heard voices in the night calling, them Benz' engine roaring
Heard that gin and champagne pouring and niggas balling
I put the 22 on my waist
The face in the moon had a mean look
I transformed to the Queens wolf

You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying
You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying

Waking up is a pleasure though last night I can't remember
Cash up on my dresser, where'd it come from? This is messed up
What kind of fatal drug am I taking? Who laced it?
Previous night memories who erased it? Wasn't even wasted
I do recall the nightfall, loner the stars around it
Then my man called, said what I did, the goons were talking 'bout it
Singing me praises, I lit the corners up
It sounded like Vietnam screaming out Q Vietnam the loudest
"Homie them dudes is scared you gon' spray 'em, word to Bing
They'll do anything, pay you real good to be on their team"
So that explains the money and the chains that's on my dresser drawer
That wasn't there a day before, I should press 'em all
But I be on some cool shit, my nigga, Q-U shit
Audemar watch, burner piece, switch, new whip
Stoli vodka, club soda with my new chick
Ah shit, teeth showing, snarling when the moon's lit

You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying
You could hear me growling through public housing
No telling, might wake up in Queens house or Rikers Island
A Queens wolf
Ladies wanna get beside him
If haters try busting the silver bullet inside him, they dying








 
 

It Never Ends




Buckets like Gilligan
Still I peep reptilians in the Filligan
Blendin' in, my quintillion ton brain
Got me revealing men
Quintessential Queensbridge poet back to the grill again
Did songs with Chubb Rock to Chris Brown, switch styles
Yet to see any heavyweight make it to this round
This that pure champion sound, I wear the crizzown
Raw, one take, I don't even need a mixdown
Demure, not docile, volatile, I kick down
Amphibians, reptiles who make that hiss sound
They eyes change color, their pupils start to slit down
When I take cover, and I let off a fifth round

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
Rest in peace to B.I., the shit never ends
B.I.G. shit
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
The world's going crazy, this shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)

S  waiting for the hood to 'preciate ya
Whoever gets love in the hood, he's a freak of nature
When I said I wasn't mainstream, lames scream
"What does he mean?
Who does he think he is?
His bank be hid, he hardly out
He still as hard as he was when he started out"
We count 'em out, we count 'em in
Amongst the real, never my crown in doubt
So around my house with my wiz, lessons I got from my friends
Do they love me for me or love me for them?

I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends
The world's at war, the shit never ends
Everybody packin'
I got seven MAC-11s, about eight .38s
Nine 9s, ten MAC-10s, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
It never ends, the shit never ends (Never ends, never ends)
What will it take to end?

Can't see me moving, I'm like the fastest
I'm a 3D movie, no need of glasses
They hate it before they hear it
Clear that my perseverance is somethin' they can't bear
It's become apparently clear
They fear me, I'm not dying or rather
Put my ears to the blaring cop siren
Am I here or in a hot dryer?
Didn't hear all that pop-soundin' fakespeare, pop rhymin'
Niggas should s  lyin'
Why in a whole year, you still in the same spot trying
To change, but you not risin'?
When will somebody real tell him he not Nas-in'
Cars, you just started drivin'
I've been ridin', been made it
You and your pretend stages
I did this since windbreakers (Windbreakers)








 
 

You Mean The World to Me




Where we met, I had to give her mad respect
She was with her man, he took a drag from her cigarette
He told her he'll be back, he jumped in the meter cab
Gestured to her cell to tell her where to meet him at
Now she was mad, and I was looking for my car
She had some plastic bags, coming from the supermarket
Cooking for his ass, how she gone get to the projects?
She ain't got no cash, and she strugglin' while walkin'
So I drive past, yo I say "I ain't no stalker wit yo big 'ole ass
Here's my help I'm tryna offer, I give you a lift"
Who woulda knew it turn to this, now we in the mix
Baby moved up in my crib and she left her ex
Damn I'm speedin'

Now girl, you mean the world to me

I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in
I'm a king, you're a queen
His and hers sinks and the diamond rings
You don't have to look back at him
Just get your bags packed and then
A new life soon begins
Like I told you when I'm in, I'm in

Baby girl had a son
He was three, yeah I took him in
Now she call him little me, I even look like him
Nah, I mean he look like me, a couple shades darker
She be calling him Blackie, that's 'cause his real father jet black
So she treat him like it's a setback
I don't respect that
Now his pops calling collect at the new crib on the new number
Now how he get that?
See, now I knew we was a mismatch
I'm laid back, you too used to getting pimp smacked
I see where I went wrong at
I just tried to bring out the queen in you
But when you make a girl leave her man
You never really know where she stand
How you know she really yours?
Somebody could do the same to you
(Same to you, same to you)

Oh oh





Talking to this cutie on facetime
Trying to figure out if she gon' give me that face time
I don't wanna tour, I wanna chill with my son more
Teach him about Egypt and tranquility, critically analyze black lives and respectability
Why Prodigy mural get vandalized?, why Prodigy?
The project politics obviously
Demagogue democracy, in the fog I see the mob represented into the light
Back to the source where all energy comes
Ya enemy done
What's eternal?
A disease that needs a vaccination, plagues, black season
The industry ain't as friendly as it first seems
When you dream of drivin' your whip to ya house in Florida Keys
On behalf of me and Queens and all of the Gs
Bandana P will always stand as tall as the trees
First things first, this should be understood
QueensBridge, just ain't any other hood
It's music, legacy is incredibly high pedigree
I don't mean this disrespectfully alphabetically
If it's hard to swallow and the credits of B street singing this Bernard Fowler
He sang with the Rolling Stones, background for Bootsy Collins
Marley Marl's advanced raps sound perfect timing
The early 80's, we babies, Pebblee Poo dropped
The beat was crazy and Marly was changing hip-hop
Then Marly and Shanté caught a body, UTFO
She cold, "Roxanne's Revenge", she was 14 years old
Then came the Juice Crew and the who's whos
G Rap, Rakim and Kane, beats made in the QU
I was probably playing with .32s in the lobby
It's QueensBridge over everything and everybody
I wish the 'book never came out
And everything got straightened out
Before you left, I saw you, it was all love
Except we needed to build more and get things correct
Now I gotta accept it, cause there's honor in death
Wish you was here with us P


Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shout out to Havoc, shout out to Pone
Shout out to Jungle
Shout out to Jeff
Shout out to Big Lord
The big dog (Lord)
Free Bar, Spark (Bar, Spark)
It's a lot going on
Free the kings
It's a lot going on man, it's heavy
Goodfellas man
Prodigy man
It's heavy man
We need to lighten it up
To all ya
My bros





 
 

Beautiful Life




Peace y'all, yeah
This one right here, goes to my most loyal, loyal, loyal ones
You for me and me for you
We see things alike
We live alike, in truth

The craziest things already happened, get me
Could tell you 'gon be laughing at me or you laughing with me?
My baby's mom made a book about me, she tried to out me
In Barnes & Nobles new release section she's confessin'
Now the streets guessin' the beefin' started over some woman
Couldn't be the furthest thing from the truth
Was she looking for fame, yo I hope she got it
Since then I been the object, gossip people tried to target
All women should bid
For keeping real fathers away from their kids
These rappers talkin' real shit I lived
How many been married, divorced, their ex lady wildin'
Hires a lawyer, judge awards 'em monthly eighty thousand
Stevie Wonder sent me word that he was in my corner
Blind but still sees the pain of a young performer
Used to be my rib thought it was 'til death do us
She married again and I'm wishin' all the best to her
Got me looking for my mother, all I see is suckers
She lookin' over me now sayin' don't trust 'em
Come on I'm livin', I don't need many to pray for me
Her bad, she wanna keep the kids away from their dad
Tell you lames something, spit some game
Planes carry me to Madrid, Spain, so why complain?
When you place blame, then you're defective
When you take blame, then you're respected
You gotta give me credit

Woah
Life is good, I must admit it
Woah
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah
Life is good, it's good, it's good

Uh
The craziest things just happened to me, get me
So now whatever happens next it probably won't affect me
How many people owe the feds, keep it real especially
If you an artist in this music game, the smartest ones get abused for their change
And my life is sex, super stardom, and stupid cash
So unpredictable not aware you could lose it fast
I signed my own checks, swore we paid the IRS
Somebody's stealin', I swear to God
Tsk, for now, I invest
To my incarcerated team who got life
It's not right but you still got your life
Rest in peace to Gil Scott from the kill or be killed blocks
Not from Philly but a nigga done hustled them hill s
Commercial pop artists get all the accolades
I give a million cash away to be revered like Donny Hathaway
Probably not as half as paid as I should be
But I stay in some cars and stay in some pussy
It's a beautiful life

Woah
Life is good, I must admit it (Yeah)
Woah (Beautiful life)
Ups and downs, we've all been through it
Woah (Life's still good)
Ain't no other way to do it
Woah (Yeah, yeah)
Life is good, it's good, it's good

A thin line from this gangsta life and rap stuff
I can say I never been punked, robbed, or smacked up
Proud to say I never been chased, jumped, or backed up
Or extorted for my pay stubs
Lucky or blessed from what prayer does
'Cause hey, I was riding in caravans with AK's and gloves inside 'em
And if I should spare that man who violated my trust
I gave him a pass
My man called and I value his judgement
I let it ride and thought no more of it, it's over
So if it's my turn to be on the other side of the gun
I'm granted my four leaf clover, no one's leaving me colder
'Cause I chilled and let you breathe, yes
Let's go our own ways and let the beef digress
I done seen insanity close up, schizophrenia shows up in most us
My younger brother knows this
Not Jungle, got another brother in PA
Spazzed on' em, hurt me to put hands on 'em 'til this day
I gotta say I got some fam across the USA
Cackalack to Kansas but my mans around the way had contacts
They was Spanish coppin' grams and cooking 'ye
Willie, Bo, blowing haze, Mayo next door
Joe, Martin, Slade, I'm solo these days
It wasn't my fault
I never knew the time of death and maturity would sever my crew up in New York
Barely survived
Large, I thank you for teaching me not to pop my letter P's in the booth
How to control my vocals and spit poetically smooth
I could nail it, you knew
I was your brother 'til death
Back when you put me on to NiQuay from Lefrak
You was a dime, we was nobodies
Say what's up to Shameek, send my love to Yadi
I pray we all get old if I never again go gold and sell tickets
We could all still kick it
It's a beautiful life
Beautiful life, beautiful life

Rest in peace to my brother Talik
Gone too soon
God bless your soul brother
He was wild
Some things we just can't explain
Life
It's messed up how much time get wasted that you can't get back
With your kids at an early age
First steps, first words
I can't see 'em cause you mad
Don't put yourself before the babies
Don't say crazy things to hurt that man
You hurt him enough
The good times outweighed the bad
When it was good, it was great
But because I could see him now through the courts, you mad
Okay that's how it is out here
That's life huh
You see we can't be selfish out here
We gotta live, and let love
Let the light in
To the beautiful mothers of my kids
And all the mothers around the world
Night, destiny
Life is good






[Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily
Melody, harmony, melody
Melody, harmony, melody, steadily

 
Everybody's not gon' get you but keep going
I be cruising 40,000 feet like I'm a Boeing
Doubting me, they said I would have no longevity
Instead I'm steadily repping these fundamentals
I assemble these sentences
'Cause someone said that I've been unadventurous
I've been uninterested, learning life is what matters
Chill, I'm the humble bragger
I could son a rapper, every one of you rappers
Vámonos, I be running you rappers
Adios, I don't see none of you rappers
All of y'all under me rappers
I need to golf, need a day to relax
Get a massage, Al Jarreau on the track
Al Jarreau of rap, made the Mets hat
More famous than Strawberry, y'all know this already

 
Here's our symphony
A measure by measure, a pleasure of harmony, melody
Here's the memories
I used to play 40th and Vernon every yesterday

 
Had a lot of losses
It hurt a lot losing cats but it was worth it
I gave a lot, giving back still
I catch heat 'cause I'm black and I'm ill
And I'm real and made millions and they in they feelings
They can't hide it
I don't internalize it, I ignore it
I was taught to observe it
Not absorb it, so I don't absorb it

[Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

 
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, tumbling, fumbling, fumbling
Taking over all
My reverie stumbling, stumbling, tumbling, fumbling

 
Evolution of a man and his music
The ill fill of harmonic symphonic acoustic
My Wikipedia just said it, I'm multimedia
When you rock O2 arena
You made it then it's crazy and now you gotta rock stadiums
I played it some where you tuck away and play the cut
Then they front
Then the shade come, they try to say that your day is done

[Nas & Al Jarreau]
Melody
Married to harmony
One in the same

[Al Jarreau]
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday
Here's a melody, I used to play counterpoint every every yesterday

Word
Got some Remy Martin, some good-ass cigars
Check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend wit' diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal, I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of scotch, smoke purp, and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter as love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop moves, drop clothes
Louis the XIII freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semiautomatic weapons
I brought the world "Crazy," I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince 'em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since a Tunnel escape key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginner stage, I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high, I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Best on .45, still crack ya rib sacrilege
When lids talk trash about the nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'? Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceiling, the safe, bitch
I got all you envy, but don't offend
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the '90s
Drug dealer call, rush to the bar
Move, niggas, we don't give a f*ck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks, niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact

(Nasty)
Nasty kid
(Nasty)
Yeah
(Nasty)
The kid!
(Nasty)
Nasty kid

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin', sayin' "It was Nas I used to hustle wit'"
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashes, guns on my waist past his
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joining the niggas passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I'm no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my Gs, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga









Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak niggaz played out, get f*cked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate wit my Dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
Yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin, Vegas style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin on Milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winnin them
Threats I'm sendin them, Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villians, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock I lace em
Fried broiled with basil, taste em, crack the legs
way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have em
f*ckin me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon
Grab your gun it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight
with the broke Mac it won't spray right
Don't give a f*ck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs, bug cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Chorus: samples from "New York State of Mind" (repeat 4X)]

"I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death" ->  
"I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin" ->  

 
I peeped you frontin, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin
Across the streat you was wildin
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the f*ck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop so how the f*ck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin L's sippin Coors, on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin war niggaz I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin the raw
But uhh, a thug changes, and love changes
and best friends become strangers, word up

[Chorus: first from "New York State of Mind", then "Halftime" (repeat 4X)]

"Y'all know my steelo" ->  
"There ain't an army that could strike back" ->  

 
Thug niggaz
Yo, to them thug niggaz gettin it on in the world you know?
To them niggaz that's locked down
doin they thing survivin yaknowmsayin?
To my thorough niggaz, New York and world wide
Yo to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit.. The Firm clique, Illmatic nigga
It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin
Y'all fake niggaz, tryin to copy

Fake ass niggaz yo..
(They throw us slugs we throwin em back, what?)
Bring the shit man, live man
(F*ck that son)
Nine-six shit..








"Get-get.. get down!" - [James Brown]

 
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin
Pushin cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
one day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
"Whatchu up to, the cops gon' bust you"
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
if God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
and looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein
While he lookin at centerfolds of pretty girls
showin they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin
A white dude, killed his mother durin the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein replaced
Pre-trial hearin is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out -- nobody leavin everybody

Some niggaz f*ck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggaz are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, dissapear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggaz, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin
They had the coke game somethin crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin
Took a puff, what the f*ck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas I got your back - the fools don't play"
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't f*ckin witchu
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherf*ckers

[unknown speaker]
All I really gotta say is that
if that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you ain't look at it
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody gotta make a change






 
Damn!    Look how muh-f*ckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the f*ck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the f*ck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a f*ck about a nigga like me right?
Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherf*ckin gun
I can't believe this shit....
Word up.. (word up..)

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab and me bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired
A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves
under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads

[Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)]

How you like me now?    I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

 
Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggaz shock me
I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears
fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me
Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say 
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place
where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand



 
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf
His eyes bubblin, he said, "It was on"
I felt his palm troubled him shakin
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?"
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!



















[Kids]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

 
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Got her strung on that
Heroin, cocaine, sniffin up drugs all in her nose...
Coulda died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how,
Put your hands in the air, and take a vow

[Chorus - 2x (Nas and Kids)]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

 
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this



 
Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
Then learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying "She's my queen"



Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music





 
Crime, life, bitches, money
Time..
For my Braveheart's.. my Braveheart's
Uhh, uhh, uhh.. what, what, what?
One time.. two times..

From "Breaking Atoms" to "Illmatic", to goin platinum
Shit did change course since rippin it with Main Source
Nine-one, nine-two, time flew
Out of the blue, time for a new young king to rule
Younger frame, older state of mind
Find my name on a page in your Qu'ran, I learned that, in '89
When I was slingin cocaine and baby 9's
Put it in rap and I gave y'all a way to rhyme
God guides us, from public assistance to high rises
Condos, houses where y'all can't find us
Move on your cliques in silence, and wet it up
My meal everyday was a slice and 7-Up
Took advice from a street legend
Identities have been changed, to protect the innocent
Witnessin niggaz mistakes, visits at niggaz wakes
Cause jealousy infiltrates and seals your fate


Look way deep inside yourself
Discover the diamond inside, find ya wealth
Once you get it, you gotta live it the limit
Niggaz never wanna see you with it, F*CK THEM THO'
Niggaz can't come close enough to touch the dough
The lifestyle I live is untouchable
So we clutch a few, guns that'll touch your crew
Cause we learned to do what the hustlers do

 
Different ways to come out the hood - in cuffs or a casket
or crazy, or shootin three pointer baskets
Or maybe - it's the rap shit, all type of tactics
we use to get dough, some choose kickin in doors
I asked a reverand, my mother and a best friend
less than ten years ago for me to get dough
What y'all recommend is either dope weed or blow
Cause high school was slow, and jewelry was hot
Duckin truancy cops, trains I hopped, to make it downtown
Cisco in my veins, pissed between trains
Canal Street, just lookin at rings
Outside through a glass, went in the store and asked
how much it cost, Korean man brushin me off
for some other big time customer, probably a hustler
who looked down at my small chain and chuckled up
I said, "I'll be just like you soon, motherf*cker what?"



 
To them niggaz who get life and throw a smile at the judge
Wildest thugs, who blow trial, exiled from the hood
Keepin bitches, comin through on visits
You will survive, them weak freaks think you finished
You first time in you known for poppin your toast
By your third year in you forgotten by most
Niggaz wife cut them out of they life, niggaz don't write
Friends actin like they don't be gettin your kites
It be ill, niggaz comin home and no time to get killed
Not even home a month and they get peeled, backwards
in they own backyard or in the park
One to the head, two to the heart, you should be smart
In the projects, who gon' die next?
Hoodrats know who let the gats blow and who keep cashflow
Like the niggaz know the rats, with some good asshole
Blunts be a good-ass roll while passin your 'dro



 
Feel me?
One time, huh, two times, uhh uhh uhh
What what what? Uhh uhh uhh..




Uhh

 
Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be tellin you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
know you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killin shorty future, I wonder how do we last it
Underground in they casket?    Ancestors turnin
I'm learnin somethin every day, there is no Lazareth
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggaz is chillin, gettin high, relaxin
Envisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen
What do we own?    Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
What do we own?    The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
for reperations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So s  bein controlled, we black zombies

[Chorus: (sung)]
Walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)
Walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)

 
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, f*ck behind bars
We've already gone insane
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
without fulfillin reality; too greedy and
can't have one or two chains, we need three of dem
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
on our own people and, f*ck black leaders
cause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophetless
All get down and get up
Victims walkin 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Faintin, shoutin, catchin Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies



 
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
or from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tommorrow
[roaring] .. that's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie



 
Wake up!    Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggaz won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
when you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggaz..



 
Uhh.. (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Q.B. since 1933 (know dat)
To nine-six (nine-six motherf*cker)
Check the shit

[Havoc]
Nine-six

Check the shit
My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggaz actin illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it
Them niggaz sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleamin, niggaz was scheamin
Seen the ill Beamers beamin
Triple-beam and doublin cream, had em feenin
to get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my 'rat beggin me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav got a soldier
It's gettin down it's goin down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin back tears
Told these broads, to put it in gear 
with two females that don't smile diggin they style yo
Whattup son, these niggaz done started somethin wild
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holdin the steel, I paid attention to the females
Maintain bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload
and still handle the wheel, point em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I layed back Escobar status, knowin The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born wit

[Chorus: Havoc]

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
I finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
We finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit

Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up

 
Hold it right there pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told ya
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin boulders
He's stuntin, after he left my man like that
without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus
and Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness
and step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight parasuco, with young faces
can turn niggaz Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused
by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
if they had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?"
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, "Don't grab Boo"
They started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when
they jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin
We followed them pollyin, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin too slow
We both holdin, what if them wild hoes started foldin? 
Sosa, said say no more, we started rollin
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin
There the girls go, hurry up we out in
the 940, me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggaz got murdered in the orgy

[Chorus 1/2]

[unknown lady - not credited]
Q.B.C.
QueensBridge motherf*cker
Ropin niggaz up
Cause our click is thick
Another day another dollar
More money, more murder
F*ck this shit, Q.B. up in the house




Uhh, what, what, uhh..

[Chorus: Nas (set to Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams")]

Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key
Everybody's lookin for somethin..
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin for somethin..

 
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catchin feelings



 
From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-  BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this



 
Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, givin a f*ck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?    Gettin put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt
With Jeeps tinted out, spendin never holdin out

[Chorus 2X]



Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real
Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty
Shorty, what up, huh?
Come on

[1 - Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something

 
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl

[2 - Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price 
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe

 
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again

The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down

[Repeat 1]

[3 - Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price 
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe

 
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I lent
Pay me back when you shake it again

 
Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On   out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

[Ginuwine] 
I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me)
I think you owe me some (You owe me)
The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

 
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

[Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
(You owe me something, oh yeah)
I said shorty, say what's your price
(You owe Nas)
Just to back it up
(You owe Ginuwine)
You can hold my ice
(You owe Timbaland)
Now let's say you owe
You owe us something, baby
Oh, oh, oh










Uhh,Uhh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill



Yo my wife's tired of f*cking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in 
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, keeping myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well 
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I aint shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, f*cked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I aint saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they s  me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

    

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself



Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I aint your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice


The reason that I want to be alone 
Tired of all the things that went wrong 
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

 
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On roof s, tape cd covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin large, takin it light
Pushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N - A - S are the letters that spell . . . 
NAS, NAS



"Nas is like life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half man half amazing.."
"No doubt.."

 
"Nas is like.."    Earth Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
"Nas is like.."    Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blastin, techs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Makin choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is



 
"Nas is like.."    Sex to a nympho, but nothin sweet
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'
I'm the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it, and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night
Now..





[speaking softly, gradually getting louder]
One time.. yeah.. yeah..

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus s  glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, f*ck gettin hit! [more sirens]
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
'til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH NINES OUT
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS BOUT, NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!

[whispering again]
Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic.. yeah

[gradually getting louder]
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
at all the hatred against me, f*ck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
from twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it?    I feel it in my gut
THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!!

[whispering again]
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic.. that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic..

[starting loud this time, getting quieter]
ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'M ONE MAN
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
Or wanna see me on  , too egotistical
Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done?    Fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now

All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, f*ck cash
All I need is one mic.. f*ck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world





42nd street terminal

    
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big money in most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing's figurative
I can wish it into existence, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wait a lifetime, they tell they hoes, "Nas did this"
Pointin' to they scars like, "Right here, baby, really Nas did this"
Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Demsey, Matt Black Bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, pass around the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
F*ck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I f*ck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

[Break: Large Professor]
Yo, what we talkin' 'bout niggas?
What we talkin' 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect,

    
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'
Integrity in tact, reppin' hard
They askin' how he disappear and reappear back on  
Sayin', "Nas must have naked pictures of God or somethin'"
To keep winnin' is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathin', I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump bein' up down up, play with cash

My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be out here
You know where you at?


At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth
Shit was Falicimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot
Staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reachin', soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin'
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Toker man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor theif shit, minor league shit, beastin'
Lookin' for the young, but now we older chiefin'
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Buggin' on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alchohol agin' my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I? Must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all


This for my trapped in the 90â²s niggas
For my trapped in the 90â²s niggas
Ha, for y'all niggas






(Right..)	(Right..)
Check me out y'all, Nasty Nas in your area
About to cause mass hysteria

 
Before a blunt, I take out my fronts
Then I start to front, matter of fact, I be on a manhunt
You couldn't catch me in the streets without a ton of reefer
That's like Malcolm X, catchin the Jungle Fever
King poetic, too much flavor, I'm major
Atlanta ain't Brave-r, I'll pull a number like a pager
Cause I'm am ace when I face the bass
40-side is the place that is giving me grace
Now wait, another dose and you might be dead
And I'm a Nike head, I wear chains that excite the feds
And ain't a damn thing gonna change
I'ma performer (?) show the mic warmer was born to gain
Nas, why did you do it?
You know you got the mad fat fluid when you rhyme, it's halftime

(Right..) It's halftime
(Right..) Aiyyo it's halftime
(Right..) It's halftime
(Right..) Yeah, it's about halftime
This is how it feel, check it out, how it feel

 
It's like that, you know it's like that
I got it hemmed, now you never get the mic back
When I attack, there ain't an army that could strike back
So I react never calmly on a hype track
I set it off with my own rhyme
Cause I'm as ill as a convict who kills for phone time
I'm max like cassettes, I flex like sex
in your stereo sets, Nas will catch wreck
I used to hustle, now all I do is relax and strive
When I was young, I was a fan of the Jackson 5
I drop jewels, wear jewels, hope to never run it
With more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach
Nasty Nas has to rise cause I'm wise
This is exercise 'til the microphone dies
Back in eighty-three I was an MC sparking
But I was too scared to grab the mic's in the park and
kick my little raps cause I thought niggaz wouldn't understand
And now in every jam I'm the f*ckin man
I rap in front of more niggaz than in the slave ships
I used to watch C.H.I.P.S., now I load glock clips
I got to have it, I miss Mr. Magic
Versatile, my style switches like a faggot
But not bisexual, I'm an intellectual
Of rap, I'm a professional and that's no question, yo
These are the lyrics of the man, you can't near it, understand
Cuz in the streets, I'm well known like the number man
In my place wit the bass and format
Explore rap, and tell me Nas ain't all that
And next time I rhyme, I be foul
Whenever I freestyle I see trial niggaz say I'm wow
I hate a rhymebiter's rhyme
Stay tuned, Nas, soon the real rap comes at halftime

(Right..) It's halftime
(Right..) Exhale, check it it's halftime
(Right..) It's halftime
(Right..) It's real in the field
Word life, check it


I got it goin on, even flip 'em on this song
Every afternoon, I kick half the tune
And in the darkness, I'm heartless like when the NARCs hit
Word to Marcus Garvey I hardly sparked it
Cause when I blast the herb, that's my word
I be slayin them fast, doing this that and the third
But chill, past to Andre, and let's slay
I bag bitches up at John Jay, and hit a matinee
Puttin hits on 5-0
Csudr when it's my time to go, I wait for God wit the fo'-fo'
And biters can't come near
And yo, go to hell to the foul cop who shot Garcia
I won't plant seeds, don't need an extra mouth I can't feed
That's extra Phillie change, more cash for that weed
This goes out to Manhattan, the island of Staten
Brooklyn and Queens is livin fat and
The Boogie Down, enough props, enough clout
Ill Will, rest in peace, yo, I'm out

(Right..) It's still halftime
(Right..) To the Queensbridge crew
To the Queensbridge crew, you know it's halftime
(Right..) Ninety-two, it's halftime
(Right..) Yo police, police man, yo let's get ghost
Halftime..




"The light is there."


See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

    
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey -- 
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
'Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, "Mr. Jones please come get your child
'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild"
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man ? The great-greatest man alive


Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
[Olu Dara singing]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge

Nas, Nas you don't s 
Olu Dara in the house, you don't s 
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't s 
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't s 
Tell 'em Pop 


See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
Rest In Peace Ray Charles






Uh, If I can teach somethin' so dear
And hope somebody learn somethin' from it
And give it back


They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith this was satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto madness, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
That bunch of backward gangsters
That sign of Alpha Davis
Snitches with smile-like faces got you blowin' trial I hear this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind o' waitin' is scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I subject to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight through his heart I'm still alive how did I make it this far
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way 


This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 

Like King Nasir fightin' the
British regime I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost in their world
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to
God that you ever have kid I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but
I can't keep still I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, f*ck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole 


This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
(Uh, warriors)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 


Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful If you was me
all this pain I'm feelin would bend and killed you
(I'm a Warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause
(I'm a Warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found I guess it's just a warrior's way 


To my warriors
To all these, baby Krucial
Keys! Braveheart y'all
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words:
Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'kno keep marchin'
Yea yea yea, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha
Braveheart, Braveheart
Definition of a warrior




Uhh


Pushin drop- s, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants
Yeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the   of my fade
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played, b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil
Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets
The car show, 560's, chemical afros
Acuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be, asses bustin out of they clothes
Wearin lip gloss, big door knockers pealin they earlobes
So where them years go?    Where the old gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here doe, so


The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?

Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
in army boots, yellin "Join the armed forces!"
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigger callin in the coorporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin the beast too long
The murderers wearin police uniforms, confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose
And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose
in frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children
with fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates, headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle

Niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin
'til awareness started penetratin
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin liquor
just to prove we some creative niggaz
Turnin nothin into somethin, is God work
And you get nothin without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggaz in chains
From Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wantin y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, he takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got God Son on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and gettin blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo because of that
I'm still blazin, goin out for the cause
Still rockin stockin caps, not for the waves, obeyin no laws
And it's like that

Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
Cuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse 
While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street till I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearin a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

Now he is Nastrodamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus

Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus

I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
The Nastrodamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills 
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech
Uh


Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
We gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you C.E.O. from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks  less
Lap s with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm...



Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggaz doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to s  and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'


As days goes and nights fall
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home


Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggaz
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home



And can we please have a moment to mourn?
For Pac, Biggie and Pun 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children?
Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggaz in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For very mother that held a son in the street bleedin'
Cryin' a song of sorow to dark and deep for speakin'
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em

Head in the staircase, the cellar or the roof 
Head in the studio, the bathroom or the booth 
Head from a project chick or one with crazy loot

[Verse One]
What's up kid? I know shit is rough doing your bid
When the cops came you should've slid to my crib
F*ck it black, no time for looking back it's done
Plus congratulations you know you got a son
I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
F*cking with the niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach - it's bugged
Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
At night time there's more trife than ever
What's up with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
You was my nigga when push came to shove
One what? one love

[Verse Two]
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Out in New York the same shit is going on
The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
Word to mother, I heard him fronting
And he be pumping on your block
Your man gave him your glock
And now they run together, what up son, whatever
Since I'm on the streets I'm gonna put it to a cease
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
Better chill cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
On the reals, all these crab niggas know the deal
When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
But chill, see you on the next V-I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
So stay civilised, time flies
Though incarcerated your mind (dies)
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love


Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
F*ck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend
Hitting L's while I'm sleeping
A two day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible
F*cking with the corners have a nigga up in Belleville
Or h.d.m., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's helping shorty doo-wop
Rollin two Phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oowops
He said, "Nas, niggas could be bustin' off the roof
So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce"
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
Started coughing, one eye peeked to watch me speak
I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took an l when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted he starts talking mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'cos when the pistol blows the one that's murdered will be the cool one
Tough luck when niggas are struck, families f*cked up
Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake shorty wop
One love









It's been a long time, been a long time comin
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me - this is what I am

[Base Chorus: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now.. but I won't s  now..
Cause I can't s  now.. you can hate me now..
But I won't s  now.. cause I can't s  now..
You can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..

[1st Chorus: add Nas after each pause]
Q.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon

[1st Chorus: after Nas add Puff Daddy ad lib]
Well you hate me I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherf*cker die motherf*cker die
You don't give a f*ck I don't give a f*ck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherf*ckers (do it now, do it now)
F*ck y'all!


Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest


Money is power motherf*cker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch (do it now)

[2nd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]
I won't s 
I can't s 
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

  Do it now, I   you do it now
[Puff] Let's go

You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on   there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

You think I'ma come this far, and let you niggas s  me now?
I hate you too!!    (Do it now!)

[3rd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]
I won't s 
I can't s 
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Puff] I like this.. I like the way this feels


It's a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game s , and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors
Plottin I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaws
Tried, stickin me up, but I flipped on these ducks (you tried)
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up (that's what you get)
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the fury of man
Became a monster, on   of the world, never fallin
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin
C'mon

[Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Base Chorus]

[4th Chorus: start w/ Puff Daddy, then after each pause]
You can hate me now
I won't s 
I can't s 
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Puff] You can hate me now
    niggas
[Puff] But I won't s  now
  Do it now! Get   shit over with
[Puff] But I won't s  now..
  It   gon' never s  niggas
[Puff] I can't s ..

Check, one, two


Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz
Little kids scared cops, wit bread dots
Philosophical gangsta, where violent priors
Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, or anybody tryin on the blocks I'm supplyin on
Mighty call, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the penal got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Mortar, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the   of the church steeple
When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen
It's frightening.... [scratches]


The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit


I take summers off, cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheet
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Rule which car heart, gun powder stains
Smellin like trees, set some mill on the brain
Skeemin on ya girls, bamboozled on ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Death crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause you bought a drummer sooked, from one of my boys, it's
.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night




One, two
Check, one, two [echoes]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do [echoes]

[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets, makes my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a six-cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours

[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
"It's yours!"
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip we box up crazy bitches aimin guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housin police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money gettin style, rollin foul
The versatile, honey stickin wild, golden child
Dwellin in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days, we sell it, smoke pays
While all the old folks pray, to Je-sus' soakin they sins in trays
of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin a word best describin my life, to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How ya livin large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin coke or playin spit spades in strip poker

"It's yours!"

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
  Yo, the   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
[PR] Break it down

[Pete Rock cuts and scratches "It's yours!"]

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin big Willie style
Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games
people play, bust the problems of the world today

"It's yours!"

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
   ... the world is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
Break it down

Yea aight?
To everybody in Queens, the foundation
"It's yours!"
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours
"It's yours!"
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours	
"It's yours!"
The world is yours
Everbody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours
"It's yours!"
Long Island, the world is yours	
"It's yours!"
Staten Island, yea the world is yours
"It's yours!"
South Bronx, the world is yours
"It's yours!"
Aight

[Pete Rock keeps cuttin and scratchin "It's yours!" to fade]




[shotgun blast]
[old school break beat, thugs chant "Bravehearts!" 7X]

    
Uh, uh, uh, now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step wit'
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas yo
Grey goose and a whole lotta hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse
In a white tee lookin for wifie
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive thru the city no doubt, but don't say my car's  less
Say the titties is out, newness here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot wit'
Push the pool stick in your new crib, same hand that you hoop with
Swing around like you stu-pid, king'a the town, yeah I been that
You know I click-clack where you and yor men's at
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Roof  like we bringing '88 back

[Chorus: Nas]
They shootin'! -- Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' Big/"big" money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?

They shootin'! -- Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' Big/"big" money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

    
This ain't rappin, this is Street-Hop
Now get up off your ass like your seat's hot
My live niggaz lit up the reefer
Trunk'a the car we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all the tension
Ball or convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers'ca move swift
Girls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty


[thugs chanting "Bravehearts!" 4X over DJ scratching gunshots]

    
I see niggaz runnin', yo my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk hazas
Like Pun said, "You ain't even en mi clasa"
Maybach Benz, back seat, tv plasma
Ladies lookin for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love
Lemme feel how the head is
Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest
[record scratched off, Nas rhymes acapella]
And I like a little sassiness, a lotta class
Mommy reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader, at last this a don you wit'
My nines'll spit, niggaz loose consciousness





Uhh, uhh
Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh

[Intro: repeat 2X]
No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

 
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find
where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin, I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
"No Half Steppin'" with flat  s when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
on a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made "Runaway"; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like
Somebody's always watchin, my life
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection?    Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled
Headline readin "Rapper Slain From a Man Shootin"






It ain't hard to tell, I excel, then prevail
The mic is contacted, I attract clientele
My mic check is life or death, breathin a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like The Shinin', sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a uzi on the island in my army jacket linin
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
Cause in my physical, I can express through song
Delete stress like Motrin, then extend strong
I drank Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns in hell
From the spliff that I lift and inhale, it ain't hard to tell

The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well, you feel it like braille
It ain't hard to tell, I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm +Ill+
plus +Matic+, I freak beats slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin while you're plannin ways to sabotage me
I leave em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas'll rock well, it ain't hard to tell

This rhythmatic explosion, is what your frame of mind has chosen
I'll leave your brain stimulated, niggaz is frozen
Speak with criminal slang, begin like a violin
End like Leviathan, it's deep well let me try again
Wisdom be leakin out my grapefruit troop
I dominate break loops, givin mics men-e-straul cycles
Street's disciple, I rock beats that's mega trifle
And groovy but smoother than moves by Villanova
You're still a soldier, I'm like Sly Stone in Cobra
Packin like a rasta in the weed spot
Vocals'll squeeze glocks, MC's eavesdrop
Though they need not to sneak
My poetry's deep, I never fell
Nas's raps should be locked in a cell
It ain't hard to tell



P.S. 111 at free lunch, embarrassed but managed to get a plate
We was kids hungry, Mom's working I was famished, she getting home late
So I decided now I'm in charge
Either stay full of starve, corner store like Mr. Spare-a-Quarter
Before Air Jordans, Kareem Abdul-Jabbars
Trying to cop quarters and trying to move that hard
Roll with a shooting squad
How could I not succumb? How could I not partake?
15 I got a gun, 16 I robbed a train
Licked off a shot for fun, what's got inside my brain?
A hustler's job ain't done, 'til he becomes a king
But I'm a righteous son, despite I'm in the mist of
Dudes who switch up and change
They want to carry me like I'm some kind of lame
I never let them know, I just forgive them though
Either that or the pistol blow


I remember early mornings - syrup sandwiches, sugar water, yeah
Walking up the dark stairwells, elevators was out of order, yeah
Worth 200 million now, bicentennial nigga, flat screens and condominiums
Brazilian women on Xannies they pulling off panties
I'm pushing 40, she only 21
Don't applaud me, I'm exhausted G
Me and my red cup, my blunt and my red cup
Y'all wouldn't know me without one, I keep a fresh cut
Remember talking to Biggie inside his Lex truck
Said stay fly when you bummy, keep your pajamas Armani
Hood forever, I just act like I'm civilized
Really what's in my mind is organizing a billion black motherf*ckers
To take over JP and Morgan Goldman and Sachs
And teach the world facts and give Saudi they oil back


1990's Polo Ralph Lauren on him
Gone a few years, the whole world snoring on him
Girls all up on him, I spread them, hit them and dead them
She says, "third leg from a legend is sheer heaven"
She says, "it is the greatest loving"
The tales you hear is the truth, on me
Who wasn't the most faithful husband
Reveal my life, you will forgive me
You will love me, hate me, judge me, relate to me
Only a few will, this how it sounds when you too real
They think it's just music still
Well I am a graphic classic song composer
Music notes on sheets, I wrote this piece to get closure
Some of y'all might know Kelis - this goes to her with love
Also goes to y'all, let's see
The craziest things already happened to me
So either you'll be laughing at me or you're laughing with me, ha



42nd street terminal

    
Yo, yo, I live it and I speak it
My religion is reefer
Big money in most, an uninhibited freak to sleep with
My visions are realistic, nothing's figurative
I can wish it into existence, God want this nigga to live
Blunt big as a dread, I get high and forget who bled
Who we stomp-kicked in the head and who we left for dead
Who are you niggas? Why argue niggas?
The truth is the truth, I really put my scars on niggas
They wait a lifetime, they tell they hoes, "Nas did this"
Pointin' to they scars like, "Right here, baby, really Nas did this"
Like a badge of honor, not braggin' I'm just honest
War stories we tell them, nothin's realer than karma
Sip prohibition liquor, prohibition whiskey
Rap Jack Demsey, Matt Black Bentley, pimply
Shatterin' your silence, pass around the chalice
Due to my Indian ancestry at the weed dispensery
Official kings and gents is who I mix and mingle with
F*ck your ice, I rock rubies, amethyst
I f*ck your wife cause she a groupie, scandalous
This for my bad hood bitches, ghetto glamorous

[Break: Large Professor]
Yo, what we talkin' 'bout niggas?
What we talkin' 'bout niggas?
This is Nas, what, Nas
What, Nasty, what, recollect,

    
At seventeen I made seventeen thousand livin' in public housin'
Integrity in tact, reppin' hard
They askin' how he disappear and reappear back on  
Sayin', "Nas must have naked pictures of God or somethin'"
To keep winnin' is my way like Francis
As long as I'm breathin', I'll take chances
A soldier comin' home, twenty years old with no legs
Sayin' there's no sense to cry and complain, just go 'head
So much to write and say, yo I don't know where to start
So I'll begin with the basics and flow from the heart
I know you think my life is good cause my diamond piece
But my life been good since I started finding peace
I shouldn't even be smilin', I should be angry and depressed
I been rich longer than I been broke, I confess
I started out broke, got rich, lost paper then made it back
Like Trump bein' up down up, play with cash

[Large Professor]
My nigga's like a locomotive
Nas, we push it, mush 'em
Queensbridge to Bushwick
Harlem, Bronx, all that
You ain't even supposed to be out here
You know where you at?

    
At night, New York, eat a slice too hot
Use my tongue to tear the skin hangin' from the roof of my mouth
Shit was Falicimo, melted pot, city sweltering hot
Staggerin' drunker than those cops that 2pac shot
I was a crook by the train with that iron thing, concealed
Reachin', soon as I heard them iron wheels screechin'
When it came to a halt whoever walked off got caught
Toker man safe behind a locked door for sure
Minor theif shit, minor league shit, beastin'
Lookin' for the young, but now we older chiefin'
In my truck, play The Greatest Adventures of Slick Rick
Buggin' on how his imagination was so sick
It's ghetto beef, sinister niggas snicker through yellow teeth
Alchohol agin' my niggas faster than felonies
How dare I? Must be, somethin' in the air that corrupts me
Look at my upkeep, owned and sublease
I'm here y'all


This for my trapped in the 90â²s niggas
For my trapped in the 90â²s niggas
Ha, for y'all niggas




Rest in peace to Black Just
Riding through Jamaica, Queens in his black truck
Timbs was 40 below, waves to the side of his dome
Definition of good nigga, yo
Gangsters don't die, niggas only become immortal
Angels don't only fly, they walk right before you
In front of you, it's foul what this money could do
Cash corrupts the loyal
I hung with E-Money, too, the f*cking truth
F*cking with Stretch from Live Squad
I could've died the same night that Stretch died
I just got out of his ride
He dropped me off and drove to Springfield
November thirtieth, another Queens king killed
It f*cked me up, y'all
I was just trying to make it with Steve Stoute
The legal way, drug-free route
Back in the days, they was sleeping on us
Brooklyn keep on taking it, Manhattan keep on making it
Trying to leave Queens out
But we was pulling them beams out, them M3's out
Pumping bringing them D's out
Rastas selling chocolate weed inside of a weed house
Colosseum downstairs, gold teeth mouth
Astoria warriors, 8th Street, twin buildings
Vernon, can't even count the Livingston children
Justice in Ravenswood, nice neighborhood
Caught sleeping out there, be a wrap, though
Bridge niggas be up in Petey's ten racks, yo
A simple bet on a serious cash flow
Get money, Manolo, welcome home, Castro
Queens-bridge unified all I ask for
Let's do it for D.U, say what up to Snatch, yo
I just salute real niggas when I pass through


Niggas is very hungry for that bank robbery
Bury money, trying to get to a Benz from a Hyundai
The Queens Courthouse right next to the cemetery
Niggas' rap sheets look like obituaries
You be starving in Kew Gardens
Bolognas and milk from a small carton
You could still feel chills from the team
On 118, my nigga Ben fly by like it's a dream
His face on his Shirt Kings
Laced in a pinky ring, in his black Benz murking
Back when Black Rock & Ron was on the map
Cheeba in yellow sacks, dope sold in laundromats
Thugs bark, getting amped from weed
Over the heart of champions, see
Ever since back then, a nigga been about the dough

(You all know how the story go) [x3]


Any other real niggas in the world besides us, I ask?
Probably is, but odds are we'll never cross paths
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell a story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This how we do, I see you D.U
Queens to the heavens, salute the hood legends
Crack the Patron, Hennessy, and Glenlivets
Champagne bottles drowning out the sorrows
Hope the memories'll get us through tomorrow
I'm a real O.G cause back in nine-three
Niggas couldn't f*ck with me, sipping 'gnac since I was little
Laid back in a rental
Mouth shining, Eddie's gold caps all up in the dental
Nigga getting money now, but you know I'm still mental, but not simple
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told ya
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling


Watch the con realest channel his mom's spirit
Goosebumps cover me, mother's here, I could feel her
Blood of Christ covers me, our savior and healer
Drug prices up or down, I know a few dealers
And some accident murderers, they act like they killed on purpose
Liars brag they put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Better stay on point, if not, it's curtains
Bebo Posse reincarnated through me, probably
If music money didn't s  me
I never claimed to be the toughest
Though I'm to blame for a few faces reconstructed
It's the game that we was stuck with
Now I'm the only black in the club with rich Yuppie kids
Sad thing, this is the  , but where the hustlers went?
No familiar faces around, ain't gotta grab the musket
It's all safe and sound, champagne by the bucket
Where them niggas I shouted out on my first shit?
Bo cooking blow, f*cking slay that, where Turkey went?
Old videos show niggas that was murdered since
Another reason to get further bent
Put your glass high if you made it out the stash spot
And here to tell your story and celebrate the glory
Drinks in the air for my niggas not here
This for the fallen soldiers
Hold it down, I told ya
Pop another bottle and keep the smoke rolling






    
You cocked back, you thought you had it planned
You thought you had your man
He saw you comin', he ran when you tried to blast that man
Missed him by inches, he sprinted
Some of his boys on the corner was who your bullets entered
Two of 'em pull through, but one didn't, son's finished
You took the life of him
The part about it that's crazy, you was aight with him
Tight with him, why was he in the way?
Why was he standin' next to the enemy that specific day?
His style never hollas loud, stays reclusive
Good dude, got that look like he always about to do shit
Side of his mouth toothpick, one eyebrow raised
Got into it with dude who still tried to live out his old wild out days
They never had no probs
Somehow they rubbed each other wrong like a bad massage
These two different personalities had to collide
Niggas could not aim and innocent niggas died
You ask why, cause of a...


Accident murderer
Act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
We grew up doin' graffiti
Now hollows heads gettin' heated
Seated in foreign cars, constantly gettin' weeded
Proceeded to count profits, I know they got on binoculars
But f*ck 'em all, we ballin' 'til they come lock us up
Twenty to life, I'm clubbin' blowin' twenty tonight
We the Marlboro, Marley Marlin' all through the night
Addicted to wealth, never cold turkey to war
Snatch a tech off the shelf, live forever that's Insha'Allah
Memoirs of a rich nigga
Sweat suits, gold chains, old drug dealers
New Benz, chrome rims off a show killer
You niggas accidental shoppers in back of the limo
Pay your ties, stay alive, can't be dodgin' my clique
Hundred check, I use your bitch for some bargainin' chips
In a hole, sell your home, nigga go sell your soul
This forty-five in control, God forgives and I don't


Accident murderer
Act like you killed on purpose
Liars brag, you put work in
You ain't mean to murk him, your gun's a virgin
Streets are full of them, read the bulletin
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

[Bridge: Nas]
Accident murderer
Accident murderer
You just an accident murderer

    
Yo, for my nigga that got killed, got hit up
Vodka spills on the concrete, light a swisha
We miss ya
And for that girl who never made it home, shot in the dome
How they gon' kill that beautiful sista?
Violent adolescents, homicidal with weapons
Not a lot of knowledge inside of they minds, that I'm guessin'
Tell me who you impressin'?
Shooters I knew them when they was babies, I used to test them
Make 'em throw up they hands, choke 'em out playin' in wrestlin'
Watch 'em grow to a man, I see them now they reppin'
But they cold-blooded, homie, wonderin' where the respect went
Can't play with these little niggas, gangsta little niggas
Can't hang with these little niggas, they killin', they reckless
Wish I could build with him, but will he change really?
Some real killers, I think of Wayne Perry
Fake 'til my nigga draws, what you want a name? Tell me
You ain't mean to kill him, it wasn't necessary











Check it out
I call it
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, Yeah

I call it "Shit for Niggas with Daughters"
I call this "Shit for Niggas with Daughters"
I call this "Shit for Niggas with Daughters"
I call this "Shit for Niggas with Daughters"


I saw my daughter send a letter to some boy her age
Who locked up, first I regretted it then caught my rage, like
How could I not protect her from this awful phase?
Never tried to hide who I was, she was taught and raised like
A princess, but while I'm on stage I can't leave her defenseless
Plus she's seen me switching women, pops was on some pimp shit
She heard stories of her daddy thuggin'
So if her husband is a gangster can't be mad, I love her
Never, for her I want better, homie in jail- dead that
Wait till he come home, you can see where his head's at
Niggas got game, they be tryna live
He seen your mama crib, plus I'm sure he know who your father is
Although you real, plus a honest kid
Don't think I'm slow, I know you probably had that chronic lit
You 17, I got a problem with it
She looked at me like I'm not the cleanest father figure but she rocking with it

This for niggas wit' daughters
I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters
Yo, not sayin' that our sons are less important

Shit for niggas wit' daughters
I call this, shit for niggas wit' daughters
I call it, not sayin' that our sons are less important


This morning I got a call, nearly split my wig
This social network said "Nas go and get ya kid"
She's on Twitter, I know she ain't gon post no pic
Of herself underdressed, no inappropriate shit, right
Her mother cried when she answered
Said she don't know what got inside this child's mind, she planted
A box of condoms on her dresser then she Instagrammed it
At this point I realized I ain't the strictest parent
I'm too loose, I'm too cool with her
Shoulda drove on time to school with her
I thought I dropped enough jewels on her
Took her from private school, so she can get a balance
To public school, they too nurture teen talents
They grow fast
One day she's ya little princess, next day she talking boy business
What is this?
They say the coolest playas and foulest heart breakers in the world
God get's us back, he makes us have precious little girls




And I ain't tryna mess ya thing up
But I just wanna see you dream up
I finally understand
It ain't easy to raise a girl as a single man
Nah, the way mothers feel for they sons, how fathers feel for they daughters
When he date, he straight, chip off his own papa
When she date, we wait behind the door with the sawed off
Cuz we think no one is good enough for our daughters
Love








[Hook: Mary J. Blige]
This kind of love is a once in a lifetime cruise
Reach out and touch the love that I have for you
I see you standing there so lost and all alone
I wanna take you in my arms
And tell you that you're home
I look into your eyes
I said I know you very well
I see a mirror of my life
A reflection of myself

    
3:45 am can't sleep, can't dream
I'm stuck, money problems pop up
How will I survive, guess it's best to decide not to decide
So that's my decision
Whatever happens happens
I keep makin' my millions
Can see myself in presidential campaign dinners
But I'm passin' blunts around a bunch of gang members
When you're too hood to be in them Hollywood circles
And you're too rich to be in that hood that birthed you
And you become better than legends you thought were the greatest
And out grow women you love and thought you could stay with
Life become clearer when you wipe down your mirror
And leave notes around for yourself to remember
I like to teach and build
With brothers about how easy it is to reach a mill
All you need is some skill, then it's grindtime
Imagination better than knowledge, say's Einstein
It's all in the mind
Nasty the nicest, I'm somewhat of a psychic
Just one minute after it's heard
You all excited, you all repeat it
So call me a genius, if you didn't
Now that I said it I force you to think it
Write in my little vignettes, sipping Moet
When you vision me, you vision the best
When I was young they called me, Olu's son
Now he Nas father, I was the good seed
He was the wise gardener

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]

    
Beautiful life, often I dream that I can bring my niggas
Conservatives don't understand slang linguistics
The burbs talking like the hood'll change with quickness
Love the skinny model chicks but I prefer the thickness
So what I rap about my riches and I'm ostentatious
Get out of gangsta business seen in me you basic
Try to compare what you live to the life I master
See the fly shit I wear, you try to rock it after
Big bracelets, golden Egyptian faces
White wine spritzers and Switzerland on vacation
The strip club scene favors Josephine Baker
Dope fiend neighbours, growing up I've seen paper
I describe it, hope you can visualize it
This is reminiscent to all the parks in the project
When my British Knights, can rival your foamposites
Don't make me pull my lotto's out the closet

[Hook: Mary J. Blige]


Lies and the pain
Betrayal, life

[Verse 1: Anthony Hamilton]
In danger's face
Look what you're facing, gave your heart away
And all the remedies couldn't ease the pain
All the hurt and betrayal; need to get away
In a world so cold
You gain your life just to lose your soul
Never thinking twice 'bout what the future holds
All the lies and the games not worth fighting for

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction, serving up a fix
The world is an addiction, way too much for me

    
Snitches and rapists in the street, crime to the fullest
Asking niggas if they got any extra nine bullets
They deny me that, they know the bullets they loan me
Be the same ones that probably had them lying flat stretched out
Letter T
It's better to dead a beef than let it breathe, then we don't succeed
Cause then you gotta murder dummies
Waste your time, they allergic to money
I'm never squeamish to blood, we can thug, and get out of hand,
What's the options?
Only conclusion is shooting, bullets poppin',
Hoodlums dropping, fear any day that the feds will come knocking
Was young and nervous, asking myself what's my purpose,
In the back of a patty wagon, bracelets, aching me
Pigs ignoring, I'm asking what precinct they taking me
These cops can't relate to me, death to prison, empty vacancy

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction, serving up a fix
The world is an addiction, way too much for me

    
Thou shall not be selfish, real nigga commandments,
Know a billionaire he has everything but a fam,
Guess how angry this man gets, had so many bad chicks in his bed,
Strange sex, same sex, has addictions that are sadistic
Chain of events, habits, he puts cocaine on his prick and acts sick
Self-esteem needs boosting alcohol consumption
Nicotine fusion, some athletes juicing
Pastors quote biblical chapters, Psalms
All along he's into bestiality porn,
And it's wrong, so I keep the Cali weed in the bong
And I'm strong, but the female anatomy got me sprung
And these women need shoes and bags, cars and condos
Fine clothes, and these fiends needs to get high, so they find dough
To mainline dope, and ya'll know

[Hook: Anthony Hamilton]
The world is an addiction, serving up a fix
The world is an addiction, way too much for me

    
So many vices, habits, mine of course, bad chicks
My response to any advice on what is the essentials of life
I'm just rebellious, not selfish,
Guess we all share different definitions of what wealth is
I need the best things in life that's women, that's cars
Cigars in Venice, bottle on ice, that's priceless
The other night, just in the emergency room
A patient said she needs to see a doctor soon
Doctor busy operating on a lady who's sedated
He can barely concentrate, cause he's newly separated
His estranged wife likes entertaining her acquaintance
In the house they were married in, mad people waiting
Some young, some old, heads and stomachs aching
Filling out an application, cause they all need medication
But the doctor need love or a quick vacation, calling up his travel agent
Same time, premeditating murdering his ex wife
Life, savage ain't it
Some need Xanax, just to maintain it
We all need faith cause the world keep changing
Let go of the illusion, start some restraining

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton]
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on (just hold on)
Just hold on







[Intro: Miguel]
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby let me take pictures

 
Life is good, life is good

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Cîroc on splash, summer on smash
  all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank   on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)

    
Got the summer on smash, eighteen karats
Little overweight, hit the gym, let's go get the abs in
Louis belt hangs on the waist, it ain't even fastened
I'm trying to get every number from every woman passing me by
She's fly; black, Asian, Boriqua
Italian, mixed chicks, Middle Eastern
Eritrean, Ethiopian, how you opening?
Just rolled four with them, bout to smoke again
Rose-gold Rollie, riding the   down
How does Pucci bathing suits on a yacht sound?
Send a massive e-mail to the females
Tell 'em where to meet us, give 'em the details

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]
Cîroc on splash, summer on smash
  all gone, got the on summer on smash
Tank   on, summer on smash
My neck got a whole lot of glass
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)
Look at baby girl showing that ass
She let the world know the summer on smash
Got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Everybody get the summer on smash
We got the summer on smash, summer on smash
Y'all know who got the summer on smash (we do)

    
We got the jam here, check it
It's the summertime, women damn near naked
It's single season, they choosing who to mess with
I just smashed another belt for the record, respect it
Nas get you out your seats, play this in your Jeeps
My people in the streets, I make it feel like it's the beach
My goons close by, I'm daring one of y'all to reach
I'm protected like the President, ain't gotta give a speech
Got a compass on the wrist, Illmatic on the feets
And they ain't even out yet, she like Ciroc peach
Chain-smoke cigars, count a whole lot of cash
And y'all already know who got the summer on smash

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]

[Verse 3: Miguel]
I gotta do something kinda unexpected, huh?
Bad bitches, champagne wishes
Freaks only, baby let me take pictures
Skin, sin; wait do you know whose pool you're in?
Beaches in Brazil, steaks on a grill
Your body is a weapon that you can't conceal
Real, make money when the freaks call
Summer on Mars, it's totally Total Recall
Like
Una vida, she butterfly
Caliente
Mami vente, vente comigo, ayo

[Hook: Swizz Beatz]







    
Yeah, Harlem, Bronx, Brooklyn
Let's make a bet, I know the reason you ain't make it yet
You say you set, but you ain't see the tedious ingredients
That go inside of a rider, you hiding from problems and
You never knew how to make dollars
You couldn't make orders at a drive-through McDonald's
I was fly at the Apollo with black Jason, '89 with a bottle
Niggas jealous of Jason, dark green seven forty, no tint
Rollie on wrist, gleaming he rock the baldy
Used to ride with him to Brooklyn, Lewis, and Halsey
Cop chocolate thai, Vernon style and burn it down
My nigga hype in the federal joint, verdict out
20 years getting money in the dirty south
That's alleged, you see my nigga's a stand up dude
So I'm yelling free my nigga
My nephew godfather Malik, he jammed up too
For what his hands usually call for, but he ain't do it

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am
Cause where I'm from, man, what I see
You wouldn't understand where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
Cause where I'm from and what I see
You wouldn't understand where I been, where I been

    
You ever been on the other end of a robber's revolver?
Not me, call me Lucky Nas Casalana
All been shot in the medulla oblongata and survived
And praised God with a bullet, I never collided
Some did and they lived, I salute the gods
Moet spilling, splash my mistake on my Timb boots for y'all
N.Y. nigga, Adidas, jogging suit
Shelltoes, slim, fly nigga
Hudson River, rent a boat, t-shirt with a dinner coat
A vintage Fila like I'm the ghost of Domencio
On any day getting throwed in a tinted vehicle
Like a old BK gangsta, but I'm the CEO
Of Nasty Nas Enterprise, mastermind, made men
My success symbolizes loyalty, great friends
Dedication, hard work, routine builds character
In a world full of snakes, rats and scavengers
Never make choices out of desperation, I think through it
Break through walls like Pink Floyd
And drink fluids of all kind of alcohol, y'all
Vineyards in France, yachts out in Cannes

[Hook: Victoria Monet]
Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am
Cause where I'm from, man, what I see
You wouldn't understand where I been and what I do
No matter how you try you never can
Cause where I'm from and what I see
You wouldn't understand where I been, where I been

 
Now holla at a millionaire
Rollie, Hublot and Audemar, deciding which one to wear
Who to screw, what to drive, 550 with the cream guts inside
Or the Super Sport Range truck is fly
Diamond ring on my knuckles like fire, bitch
Gat's on us, I don't really trust these guys
Spend a couple bucks a night on bottles on cuties
If she beautiful, the lustful type, I'll hit it and bust inside
F*ck it, I'ma die one day, they gon' probably make that day a holiday
Until then, let's go on a shopping spree
Speaking for my real niggas, only OGs
Certified who kill niggas when put in that seat
But tonight we on chill, nigga, chill mode
Spill more Spades, listen to Jeezy and Hov, some Rozay
It's like we always on the grind with no brakes
So tonight we gon' act like we on vacation with this on rotation

[Hook: Victoria Monet (Nas)]
Who you are ain't in the recipe to what I am (word)
Cause where I'm from, man, what I see
You wouldn't understand where I been and what I do
(Y'all wouldn't understand)
No matter how you try you never can
(You wouldn't last a day in my shoes, homie)
Cause where I'm from and what I see (yeah)
You wouldn't understand where I been, where I been

[Outro: Nas]
True B nigga, yeah
For my hood niggas, yeah, yeah
To my man Eric B., what up, yeah
The whole city, I see you
To my man Big Slate in the fed joint
My man Spunk, free my niggas
All my niggas, yeah
Club Vernon, I see you
I see you, yeah
And Baltum, I see you

 


The ill reminisce and think about the fly days
Nothing like them 80s summer N.Y. days
Hop on the NB5 days
Mopeds, Pro Keds, city split five ways
How it all started, fifth floor apartment
A jigsaw puzzle aerial view of the projects
A kid saw struggle, buried a few of his partners
Now chill in resorts, enjoying massages
Check out the oracle bred from city housing
Nas, I'll rise the deads by thousands
I remember seeing Shan chilling near his Audi
Hollis Ave, Run and them but I proudly
Put a poster up of Shan and Marley, that was art kid
You love to hear the story how it started
The bubbly I'm pouring wasn't popped yet
Before there was a audience to watch us
I assure you, there was a process


"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"
How it all got started, yeah
"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"
How it, how it all got started
"You love to hear the story how it all, how it all got started"
Hear the story, started off
Started off, started off
How it all got started
"Back when, back when, back when, back when
Back when, back when, back when, back when"


To call them fake today is hate, real niggas extinct
Pac left me inside a rap world with niggas that wink
At other rappers, undercover niggas spit every way
Won't be surprised if all their rides have federal plates
Let alone their wardrobes and Studio 4 flow
It was real when I appeared, it would've been some jaws broke
Nas, my real name, stage name, same thing
How could you let these lames claim king? I'm so ashamed, man
I light a L for Vernon, for niggas who would burn in Hell
For Vernon; 10th Street, 12th Street, Nightmare on Elm Street
Pimps creep, delve deep inside the editorials
Of the ghetto queens, kings, stories true
Who possesses the testicular fortitude
To blow away myths that's a hindrance to all of you
You blame your own shortcomings on sex and race
The mafia, homosexuals and all the Jews
It's hogwash point of views, stereotypical
Anti-Semitic like the foul words Gibson spewed
And it's pathetic, I don't get the credit I deserve
That's why I hate doing interviews
But I don't sweat it, study long, study raw
My man Dion said "Nas over-think the songs he writing"
I'm not a wack performer standing near a corny hype man
I got the Donism in me, I'm here to enlighten


"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"
How it all got started, yeah
"You love to hear the story, how it all, how it all got started"
How it, how it all got started
"You love to hear the story how it all, how it all got started"
Hear the story, started off
Started off, started off
How it all got started
"Back when, back when, back when, back when
Back when, back when, back when, back when"




 









[Intro: Super Cat]
Super Cat
New York girls Dem A mad ova wi [4x]
Nas the Don [8x]
In a new york city [4x]


Yea.. yea
Smoking a escubano, guzzle my second bottle
Hope I don't catch a homo (homicide)
Grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher, heinous crimes behind me
Search but can't find me
F*ck sadness
Had this been you havin' this lavish
Habitual happiness at me you wouldn't look backwards
You would have sex on condominium roof decks
So anyone move next
I'll hit you with two techs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli no shirt on convertible Mazy
My Columbiana mommy ridin beside me
Every tat mean something, that's my word on my body
I'll have to lean something wit that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in yo pigment
Just cuz y'all was mad at all the years I was getting it
In 97 the six
98 the Bentley
Now it's the Ghost Phantom
And ya'll can't stand 'em but...


Nas the Don [8x]
In a new york city [4x]


Army Jacket swag Army jacket green and black
Wit the square   pocket that snaps
Where the gas at?
Pass that, not you
You hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that, my sock where my stash was at
Yo I used to listen to that red alert and rap attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cuttin school with Preme team at phat cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet Baccarat
Now I'm the one that's reppin Queens way beyond your wildest dreams
Bottles on bottles with sparklers surround my team
That long cash get the baddest bitches out they jeans
20 years in this game lookin 17
I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although he's on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to
Blaaaah...




Yeah yeah..
New York is like an Island a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wildin, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving same old two step
Tryna stay alive when
They be out robbin, I been out rhyming
Since born knowledge like prophet Muhammad
Say the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
So I'mma
Keep it on til I see billion dollars
Keep your friends close and ya enemies closer
Love model chocha mommy pop it like she suppose to
Eyes red shot like I'm never sober
Big time smoker Indonesian doja
Minis me you can hold up before you get all wet up from my soldiers
Don shit
Under fire I remain on some calm shit
This for every ghetto and the hood
Nas the Don and Supercat the Don Dotta
Understood...




 


Peace to the Five Percenters, online engine inventors
Shout to them niggas, family men, bringin' home dinners
Watch out for desperate lonely women, hurt ya happy home
Miserable and alone, kissable, nice to bone
She not the type deserving of a throne
Her beauty is her curse, she f*ck for shoes and a purse
Make me a movie first, can watch you on my phone
I shop in Barcelona, I spend some nights in Rome
Feel like a knight from England, that's what I named my son: Knight
He was born to be one, that's how my game was won
White 740 Beamer, licked by an angel's tongue
I'm livin' dangerous son, she got a man, a famous one
Honey be pocket watchin', she got a lot of options
Hard to make up her mind decidin' which baller to rock with
Hot to death, slim pickings, but I'm not impressed
She got the hottest sex, so I guess I'ma just...
Stay


Even though I don't like you, next Friday night can't wait to fight you
Locked up I would knife you, don't f*ck with you
Last month I even bucked at you, you got locked
I felt bad, wait, do I got love for you?
I might kill you, but do I got love for you?
I want you dead under 6 feet of soil
At the same time, want you here to witness me while you in misery
We hate each other, but it's love, what a thug mystery
Years ago they ate the heart of a slain enemy
We enemies, but your hatred could never enter me
Some seek fame cause they need validation
Some say hatin' is confused admiration
Spotlight on me, I still look twenty
Still get money, lady killer pushin' a Bentley
Maybe niggas could see too much of they failures through a nigga who realer
I don't like you near bruh, but I need you to...
Stay



 


[Amy Winehouse]
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
I heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
Where is he?
The man who was just like me
Heard he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone, and I realize that when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry
Yes I'm alone, and I realize when I get home
I wanna go through my red and my cherry

    
I want some who like the champagne I like
My a-alike, someone to talk me off the bridge any day or night
She teach me how to live, she ain't afraid of life
Not easily impressed with the rich and famous life
Cause she done been there and heard all the rumors before
She love or she ride out with me on my music tour
She like the herbs natural medicine, she cooking good
She tell me everything is cool and looking good
For real, the world so ill
Yeah I want a girl so real
Who not after material wealth, but get dough still
Or maybe an educator, a lady with etiquette
Who can be from out the hood, or even work for the president
As long as there's no selfishness
Yes, as long as her love for the people is deep rooted and evident
You can be easily recruited, you're heaven sent
Your smile, put me on ease
You're the woman I need, but where is she

[Amy Winehouse - Chorus]

    
I hate when people write me hostile texts on the count of my lifestyle's perception
Invade my personal life, out of the question, what are they expecting
I be tryna reply them, and they never suppose I get my quiet time in
They think forever I'm rolling in dough, swimming in a pool of cash
God, wouldn't they know, or am I a fool or as
I'm well known, got people coming at me mad
I had a tell homes, I don't keep a cell phone
My bad, I drag, off the l and try to silence it
The noise of my head, the curse of the talented
Strong communicator, vagabond, I gallivant around the equator
And that would get me off the radar
It's so intense, I'm on my Lilo and Stitch
Pour my Pino Grigio with some lime what is this?
An immaculate version of me and my baby
With all respect cause you the only one that gets me

[Amy Winehouse: Chorus]

[Nas - Bridge:]
Yeah, yeah, let's pour some cherry wine
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, yeah we bring it every time
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine
Yeah, Hey yo Salaam, yea, I think they know the time
Everything's good, everything's fine
Yeah, pour a little cherry wine, yeah
Life is good, life is good, yeah
Life is good, no matter what
Life is good, life is good
Life if good, yeah
No matter what
Life is good

[Amy Winehouse: Chorus]

[Amy Winehouse]
Man who was just like me
I heard he is hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone
And I realize that when I get home
When I wanna go to my red and my cherry
Yeah-oh-oh-ooooh
The man who was just like me
Cause I know he was hiding somewhere I can't see
And I'm alone
And I realize when I get home
That I wanna go to my red and my cherry

(Life Is Good)

 


I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby


Bye baby, I guess you know why I walked away
When we walked to the altar that was an awesome day
Did counselling, couldn't force me to stay
Something happens when you say I do, we go astray
Why do we mess it up, we was friends we had it all
Reason you don't trust men, that was your daddy fault
He in the grave, let it go, he no longer living
Said you caught him cheating with mom and other women
F*ck that gotta do with us
Here's the keys to the newest truck
Birkin bags, we burnin' cash, now baby do it up
No matter who you f*ck, that was before me
Wanted you as my shawty since I saw you screamin'
"Hate you so much right now"
Should've saw the man in angry black women
Ashes of a demon, I'm leaving


I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby (Bye baby)
You know I'm saying bye-bye (Bye-bye baby)
Cause I'm sayin' bye-bye (Bye baby)
Cause I'm sayin' bye-bye
I guess you knew and blew a good thing, baby


Bye baby, I guess you know why I had to leave
Seven months in your pregnancy, 'bout to have my seed
Let's take it back some years, rewind it to the happy years
You and your Star Trak fam, I'm thinking you cats are weird
Same time, different year, I was diggin' ya flow
Then I tatted you on my arm so niggas would know
I thought no one could s  us, matching gold watches
I was your Johnny Depp, you was my Janis Joplin
Yet, the cuter version, yet I knew you personally
Better than you knew yourself and I knew this for certain
Crib in the Dominican you got away from everybody
You screaming at the racist cops in Miami was probably
The highlight of my life, like "Hi yo look at my wife"
Gangsta, me and twenty cops 'bout to fight, crazy night
Bailed you out, next morning we got clean
Like it never happened and later we at that Heat game
Just another day in the life of two people in love
But it wasn't enough, so baby guess what




Listen, could you imagine writing your deposition?
Divorce Lawyer telling you how this thing gonna be ending?
With you paying out the ass, and I'm talking half
Not some but half. No serious, half
Half of your soul, half of your heart you leaving behind
It's either that or die, I wanted peace of mind
And all I seen was selfish cowards, under they breath
Saying "why did Nas trust her?", but look at yourself, speak louder bruh
You live with your babymoms and scared to make an honest woman out of her
And make her your bride, fake bitch you ain't even alive
At least I can say I tried plus enjoyed the ride
Plus we got our little boy, my little joy and pride
He got my nose, my grill, your colour, your eyes
Next go round I hope I pick the truest type and watch me do it all again
It's a beautiful life, aight
Goodbye









Word
Got some Remy Martin, some good-ass cigars
Check it out

Ayo, late night, candlelight, fiend wit' diesel in his needle
Queensbridge leader, no equal, I come from the Wheel of Ezekiel
To pop thousand-dollar bottles of scotch, smoke purp, and heal the people
Any rebuttal to what I utter get box-cuttered
Count how many bad honeys I slut, it's a high number
Name a nigga under the same sky that I'm under
Who gets money, remain fly, yeah, I wonder
Eyes flutter as love when Nas pops up
Stars get starstruck, panties start drippin'
The ways of Carlito, blaze, torpedo cigars
Drop moves, drop clothes
Louis the XIII freaks, women nice size
I ride like Porsches, thick, brown and gorgeous
It ain't my fault, semiautomatic weapons
I brought the world "Crazy," I'm rich and I'm girl-crazy
Dick 'em, convince 'em all to praise me
They ideology is confusion, I lose 'em
Fellates me, who hate me? My gun off safety
Since a Tunnel escape key, my jewelry in HD

Silent rage, pristine in my vintage shades
I'm not in the winters of my life or the beginner stage, I am the dragon
Maserati, pumpin' Biggie, the great legend
Blastin', I'm after the actress who played Faith Evans
My little Jackie Onassis, dig?
I'm so high, I never land like Mike Jackson's crib
Best on .45, still crack ya rib sacrilege
When lids talk trash about the nasty kid
Past nasty now, I'm gross and repulsive
Talk money, is you jokin'? Cash everywhere, in my bank, in the sofa
In the walls, in the cars, in my wallet, in my pocket
On the floors, ceiling, the safe, bitch
I got all you envy, but don't offend
I'm skinny, but still I'm too big for a Bentley
You are your car, what could represent?
Too Godly to be a Bugatti, you honestly
Must design me somethin' Tommy Mottonic from Queens had before the '90s
Drug dealer call, rush to the bar
Move, niggas, we don't give a f*ck who you are
Black card heavy like a magnet, in my stitched denims
Pretty women see them them saggin'
Bet a hundred stacks, niggas'll run it back
Just havin' fun, I ain't even begun to black
Light another blunt in fact

(Nasty)
Nasty kid
(Nasty)
Yeah
(Nasty)
The kid!
(Nasty)
Nasty kid

For the hustlers, thick as yellow bitches for the suck of it
Got a bunch of niggas in prison braggin', sayin' "It was Nas I used to hustle wit'"
I display fashions while my lungs engage hashes, guns on my waist past his
Since I'm cakin' up, put funds in my safe, laughin'
And joining the niggas passin' you niggas was straight assin'
Excuse the vulgarity, I'm still not fully adjusted
Or used to the new fans hearin' me spit rapidly
I never see the whips niggas be claimin' they drivin'
I guess entertainment means blatantly lyin'
Fake it 'til you make it, I've driven those toys
Been in the wars, in the streets, cops kickin' in doors
For my deen niggas, your flow cheap as limousine liquor
I'm no fake rap CD listener, sit back and roll a mean swisher
For my Gs, tell these clowns make room for the king, nigga


 


I pull a string on a lamp and shit darkens
I'm living in an elegant Moroccan apartment
Proletarian chicks sparkin'
Convo weak, and I don't really care for her jargon
Balcony is windy, looking at the stars and
I be on the Henny woozy in the head, wobblin'
Gucci pillow on the bed while she giving noggin
Listening and tripping off the Maxwell album
Thinking I should leave to a European island
Bristol or Spain, bring a book about Stalin
Dinner serenaded with a violin
But shorty not qualified to be took to that kind of outing
Gotta be a fly bitch to hang around that fly shit
Fine dining, Olive Garden
Nah bitch, Nas is in the real deal food spots on the constant
Pick the right wine, a Chianti to wash it
Lifestyle encompasses   notch watches
Rolexes, synonymous shit I'm coppin'
Ask her has she been around duffle bags
Full of that "f*ck you cash"
Get off the jet with me in heels, I'll cup your ass
Lookin' in my eyes sayin' "Nas, you one lucky bastard"
Grip your clutch, you get finger f*cked in the passenger
I hit the Dutch, blow smoke out, music and laughter
See us in the coupe flying past ya


Esco, dress code, it changes
Harrods in England
Back to the star spangled labels in my closet hanging
Counting wonder in the tundra
Get humbled but disgruntled when I come through, confront ya
Let nothing slide, sly remarks
You must wanna die, but you frontin' wild
When we all know you pumpkin pie
When we in the bus we fly better shit than Emirates
To Dubai, to the Chi, I'm a crucial conflict
Heaven sent, cause a storm, typhoon flood you out
You are what a thug about? I'm a f*ckin' juggernaut
Never sleep, never tire, keep a freak I tie up
Who don't speak, she quiet
So I can think, conspire
On my feet's [?], and sometimes sneakers
Wear ties at the Setai Miami time-pieces
Are from Zurich. It's like I'm allergic
To non-oxidolic nine
Give it to you raw so you can feel it
 

 

 
 
 
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn in my hide
I should've known, we can't repair what we broke
But I held you close
Too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more

    
I have no time to give you guidance
Barely have any f*ck time either
Hefner minded like, I think you're fine, but
I seen the finest women that ever came out a beaver
Mind reader, can tell she vegan or not when I meet her
Or if she insecure, most are
If she's mixed, a possible psycho alert goes off
Not a judge cause a judge don't wear no draws, yet he allows
Everything to go to your spouse when you end your vows
My tax bracket not enough blacks have it
Who should I date? Project chick or Cuban actress?
A white chick, they might flip talking that blackness
Should only attract black shit, I'm an ass magnet
If you mad at that, you'll be mad forever
Never played you, I prayed we would stay together
Wished it'd last forever, know what I mean
Heard you tear a rose from the roots, the rose screams

[Hook: Nikki Flores]
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn in my hide
I should've known, we can't repair what we broke
But I held you close
Too close

    
Them Xanax can't manage your maniac manic depressive expressions
They some silent killers, that stress shit
That put ulcers in a lot of niggas
I'm blowing medical, it helps chill a violent temper
I done went to hell and back, you always think you right
You know when you wrong, and still you want to fight
When people like my song, you want to kill 'em right?
You resent me every time I make a million right?
You want to experience life when you calling all the shots
Ordering bottles for all your girls up in the spot
Have your own cash, own your own Benz
Your own house, everything, me, I understand
Thought you would bask in the glory as Queen Bee
Put you on under Martin Scorsese: Mean Street
The first movie he made, thought that was fly
I thought you was flyer, you a f*ckin' liar

[Hook: Nikki Flores]
Just like a rose
Everybody knows that you are so beautiful
But I feel a thorn in my hide
I should've known, we can't repair what we broke
But I held you close
Too close
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't want them no more
I should've left your roses at the door
They're sharper than before
And I don't need them no more




 


    
At times I window watch at the Wynn hotel
Lots of thinking happens in life, will I win or fail?
Mind of a shooter, CFO also
Ethiopian food flown in, it's unlawful
Money is attractive, honey dress strapless
Agent Provocateur underwear: she's classic
Stroll up in the party: titanium black car
Romanian ladies like Casablanca, Casbah
'Cept we in the VIP area, that's ours
You know the real rap gods, typical trap star turned rap star
These old heads got stories, the days they was kings
I pray secret indictments don't take away their dreams
You 16, you could do 20, come home young
Catch 20 years when you 40? Holmes, you're done
What have we become? Rap stars from trap stars
Black gods to Ansars to Sunnis back to goonies
A 360 in the streets real grizzly
Shooters is cold, kid, the old shit was learning
Student enrollment to focus, yet hooligans roll with
Toasters to pop your medullas off of your shoulders
This ain't the Truman Show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chewing on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
It's U.S.A. against the gangsta, where's the love?

[Hook: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung? It's not love
That's f*cked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up

    
Sometimes I sit on the bench just to watch the game
Feet on cement, there ain't a mobster living I could name
Who made it out rich, in his absence I do not proclaim
To not have a heart like wild animals not tamed
Maybe just a typical thug nigga was my rank
'Cept I had a vision above niggas, what I think
It's crazy how many brothers come from where I come from
Some made it out big, some dead, some unsung
Shots for soldiers on 23 hours lock-up
Younger generation, they want to mimic and mock us
Laughing, separating themselves like they not us, like
"Cops'll look at you like they look at me? That's preposterous"
Ain't it gangsta how your man made it? I'm humble
One gun, one crazy ass nigga, that's Jungle
Now we having babies, cause growing up it was just us
No uncles or cousins to fight with us, we was f*cked up
But still it was beautiful, the love is mutual
Even though me and Jung ain't show up to your funeral
I hold your son hand, tell him he the man, we love you
Your pops was king, you have a whole lot to live up to
The G is in your genes, already you tuck
Inherit your dad's swag, it's George Jefferson's strut
Stay flyest, they gon' want to know what in your diet
Don't be surprised if they want to check your shit and your vomit
Tell them you let it marinate, they swear you made them a promise
No matter what they do, you just stay a man of honor
I'm a street corner nigga, New York Knicks loyalist
Corona sipper, pass it out, might blow it with you
It ain't the Truman show; it's the human show
Ask the F.B.I. agent at his cubicle
Chews on his pencil eraser with intents to erase you
Young brother go and get your paper, I got love

[Hook: Cocaine 80s]
Love, I'll trade you love
I've traded fire with you long enough
Is that all you brung? It's not love
That's f*cked up, but I saved your soul
Roll that up
Roll that up




 


It's like a cold story repeated over and over
In the winters of my mind
This shit be real, man
Shit's crazy out here
Yo yo, yo what up y'all?
That's my niggas over there. Word


If you scared to take chances, you'll never have the answers
I could tell the future of a dude how his stance is
Wonder will he shoot then you should study where his hands is
Is he gonna cock it and pop it? His waistband big
But he don't have that thing in him, slangin' just ain't in him
Body language is off, he's soft
But soft niggas all a sudden start dumpin', frontin'
Cause you fell away; my niggas say the eyes is a giveaway
One look could tell me if you really came to kill me
Be the quiet nigga lookin', layin' with the milli
Who dat over there, creepin'? Who homie by the tree?
Better safe than sorry, look at p-noid me
Few machine guns close, we could squeeze all three
Be a cold day in hell 'fore they creep on me
It's a lesson every premonition
Lotta niggas killed 'cause they wasn't payin' attention.
Listen


I want a bitch I can trust
Some niggas I can trust
Accountants lookin' over my figures I can trust
A lawyer that's fightin' for my decisions I can trust
Damn my nigga trust, I can never get enough
A Ruger I can trust, shooters I can trust
Goons that know how to spot out a Judas I can trust
And if I can't trust you, the f*ck is you here for?
Some of you niggas' true colors becoming clear more


It's been so long, can't remember how we begun this war
This is a ever-lasting thunderstorm, 'cause guns went off
I see ya moms she still speak,
She don't know I ain't cool wit her son no more
It's old shit, see forever we holdin' this grudge
Takes real men to squash beef, end it with hugs
We buried our dead, been years
Why should I worry 'bout him
Constantly watchin' my back
Plus niggas tellin' I dread
Another day I put a family in black
Though I be calm and relaxed
Though I know somehow it will come back
Even if I'm in the right, 'cause still a life is a life
What was it worth to see you covered in dirt?
It's quite redundant, whether you the hunter or the hunted
Mother's cry, no statute of limitation on a homicide
Just tattoos of my niggas' names. I wonder will it change?
Let's ride




It's rare I listen to niggas who never been in my position
A caterpillar can't relate to what an eagle envisions
From the mind of a man who went at it with killers
Sit down little man, let me school you in hood business
Seen a lotta niggas blow, lotta dreams folded
Some wasn't humble, ate too much, got bloated
Ain't too much left to buy, bought it I'm loaded I guess
Lear jets - I ask myself do I need love or success?
They say the artist that truly suffer his stuff is the best
'Cause his heart bleed on his sleeve, pain pistols and sex
Remember spraypaintin' the word "Fresh" and then staring at it
Older folks angry, pointin', swearin' at it
Buildings I sprayed, nowadays drive the Maclaren past it
Same old man from years ago told me life is short
So from infant to geriatric, trust ya own judgment.
Live with it and love it














Yeah, Yeah
My degrees
Like Ivy Leagues
In the street
I succeeded
The ghetto was my Garden of Eden
It was hard to defeat him -
The Beast
He tried to turn The God in to a heathen

Check It

See the Black Madonna the picture, that lady
Holding a baby?
As I looked in her eyes, what I saw did it amaze me
New Orleans under water
Screaming, "Somebody save me"
Immigrants at the border
Treated wronger than Dalo-Faelid
In India, there's plenty of poor crying babies
Back at the home front, jobs wanted like crazy
Me, I'm never selfish, indeed help the helpless
Looking at the sky for Almighty, can you help us?
I can't stress what I can't control
Heart of a street hustler, Panther soul
As I sit on the throne
What's not in the stars, I just let it go
Favorite Golf linen clothes
So I pray to God... that a new plan unfolds
I got a saying and it goes,
"I started in the projects,
Now look what I accomplished"
There's ain't nobody helped me
It's nonsense
I'm just
Honored
To be in this position
The best feeling
That I've ever had is when I'm giving
Listen









Oo ah ah ah ahhh (maybach music, it's deeper than the verse baby, it's deeper than the rap).

People talkin down callin me a damn sprug,
Young niggas all u wana do is roam free,
On your own feet gotta cook your own beef,

Black philip drummin limousines of the hummer,
Penthouse sweet, pretty beach I call the summer,
Lotta homies pass,
See em in the future,
Moneys so fast, on the gas, never neutral,
Gotta keep a shooter while I'm ridin in the 7,
Higher than a kite by the time I get to heaven.

[Nas:]
And still my talent is yet to be challenged,
Had new jet with my own pilot,
No blastin off, but flexin, Dj Khaled,
My mom stressin college,
But my crude sense of logic, did a lude to my empty wallet,
Try spittiin on a green tinted accord,
Which could mean a sentence up north,
Where the homie was, but back then doe was like a hoard, it goldie love, it didn't exist,
And office foley cuffs, was after my wrists,
Was not beverly hills where we chilled,
Imagine this, the nas n rith,
Had to get from rags to rich,
I used to stand on roof s, with 2 glocks,
Figurin, how do I turn my timbalands to clocks,
Now reptiles was left out about a watch,
What is you thinkin? Murk u, plus the muscle that u bringin is nothin to me,
If you thuggin, a fake and shaked on cuban,
Shout out my ricans,
Down with all of u gangstas, to the roughest jamiacans.

[Rick Ross:]
If you ballin physics, nigga money never flow,
Meanin every day I'm livin, tryna stay on flow,
Coming from a BOSS, I can predict a double cross,
Handlers managin money, they never come across.
I spend in Africa, Magnamers, numbers involved,
AK47s, Singin win or by sum or u fall?
I dealt with brawls, and those willin to sell they soul,
Over cars and clothes, man am talkin petty hoes,
Ask ma feddi grow,
F*ck a feet of spaghetti-o's.
I'm club poppin in cali shout out to ariel,
Somebody dim the lights,
Triple black tuts,
Caz associated and the flesh is tryna catch up,
I roam with niggas who destined to get a life sentence,
Get they baby mama a lexus for them nice visits,
Ma nigga got a dub an love to do the push ups,
I got a million cash, tryna get the kush up.

[DJ Khaled:]
They doubted me all my life
Now it's victory
(DJ KHALED!)

[John Legend:]
Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line
In a hustler's state of mind

I'm gonna make history
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Oh, victory (Victory)
(Nasir!)

[Nas:]
Speedboats, three tokes and pass it
Grass lit, hittin' slopes in Aspen
No coat, just an oath to stay thorough 'til we back to ashes
Driven in fly sedans to the MGM Grand
Picture lots of sand, two blondes, implants
Remy in hand, we tryna tan, deal my cards with an honest hand
A modest man, aware of any counter-scam
Palm trees, magnum Don Ps, LV monograms
Hottest girls flew from Rio
Mojitos, mucho frio, my libido
Sex so strong, without the E, though
Hollow threats, we don't see those
Higher death toll whenever we roll
That process is pivotal
My pitiful poverty-struck criminals will get a Jew
Then we lounge in a Spanish-style house
'Til it all blows over, Dolce Gabbana out
Contemplatin', there is no bond with Satan
Say a little prayer for me like Aretha Franklin
For my hustlers, here's some motivation
He who has begun is half done, why you waitin'?
I'm too impatient to pray, too much patience for stress
It's too much paper to rest, f*ck around, you face death
I know some niggas from Astoria
That'll cut your daughter up
Like I used to cut a quarter up
Makin' all the bucks, banana clips I bought in Georgia bucks
Kill all you f*cks, easy
I be on the golf cart, sleepy
Y'all beneath me
Y'all be at the pawn shop, pawnin' watches
Obnoxious, can't s  us, we shottas
Say you killin' Pablo? Impossible
Nonsense, preposterous, bizarre at best
Unfulfilled promises
I feel intelligence is my wealth
However, how enormous is Nas' pockets is a pop quiz to gossipers
See me at the Oscars, lookin' dreamy, hood opulent
Means esoteric, how I wore it
Exoticness makes you curious to see how serious my closet is
Shareholders wanna invest in that Nas stock, it's just
We be on that real shit, luxury four-wheel shit
Niggas actin' thirst on some just-got-a-deal shit
Ha, for that victory we will kill shit
Get out the way, playboy, this is real shit
(Khaled!)

Whatever it is, I'll pay the cost
I'm willing to risk it, I'll take the loss
I'll put it all on the line
In a hustler's state of mind

I'm gonna make history
Just so we can claim victory (Victory)
Oh, victory (Victory)

Just so we can claim victory
Oh, victory
Victory

Just so we can claim victory



Life's a fog at night red brake lights
The freeway beside a restaurant
Cold egg whites sat on my plate like
3 AM this is a spot frequented by some made men
I'm high on hemp a fly old pimp
Just walked in, his suit was shark skin,
He woke me up from some of the thoughts I'm lost in
What fame does to niggas, change love to bitterness
Friends to fiends for the audience screams ridiculous
Jumped up, paid the tab got in my Benz and went
To my old housing tenement, visit my old friends
Some show love and some are envious
Some got the heart of gold, some venomous
At times I wanna go back to being penniless
Ignorance is bliss, I love being innocent
Ugh, but life's got me on the fence again
And all is real so all's worth mentioning.

    
If I could press pause, or fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still I'll, now I appeal (appear?) crisp like film

Ice on gold from mossbergs to golf clubs
Ninth hole, the white rose, the life I chose
Bandanna over the eye, Dior sandals
Car doors rise with no touch of the handles
Capiche? Capri style, it's on beaches and islands
Far from police sirens at least for a weekend
Then it's back to the streets creepin
I'd like to make a free toast of champagne on behald of this nigga speaking
Add a splash to the Seagrams
Roll the hash for my world renowned goons this evening
As I circle the table like Babe Ruth
Louisville Slugger in my grip for a fake dude
Bat to the brain with brute force
Splatter my cream velour suit
They hit me with lawsuit
I slip in your whore coupe
Your b*tch hate you, word to Jesus
Bet you never knew she toot yay and play with a gay crew
OGs hate to make way for the new
Young niggas want Polo ain't f*cking with J Crew
It's safe to say I was once young and innocent
But look what I know now, is all worth mentioning

    
If I could press pause, or
Fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still I'll, now I appear (appeal?) crisp like film

I speak to the street life
The executive chief types
The felons, young mothers with kids they trying to feed right
The botega wearers modern day Che Guevaras
Cause I barely survived crazy eras
Honest, always make good on my promise
I don't talk it I do it you can hold me to it
I was born to this life I didn't invent it
But I'd be wrong not to take a few meal tickets
You and I are real different, we don't share the same beliefs
Fight in the ring or buy ringside seats
Either you like beef or you like to spectate
Give me gloves, and I'm a do it how the refs say
We touch em and we come out tussling
The ghetto is my garden of eden
So I keep bobbing and weaving
It's intense so I'm hardly breathing
KO, and the winner is Nas, that's how the scene ends

    
If I could press pause, or
Fast forward past the hardness
Visions written bring words to life like I'm smitten with
Memories real, still I'll, now I appeal (appear?) crisp like film




(with Damian Marley)

[Damian Marley]
As we enter
Come now we take you on the biggest adventure

 
Must be dementia, that you ever thought
You could touch our credentials, what's the initials?

[Damian Marley]
You be Jamrock the lyrical official
Send out the order, laws and the rituals

 
Burn candles, say prayers, paint murals
It is truth we big news, we hood heroes

[Damian Marley]
Break past the anchor, we come to conquer
Man a badman, we no play Willy Wonka

 
And I got the guns

[Damian Marley]
I got the ganja

 
And we could blaze it up on your block if you want to
Or haze it up stash box in a Hummer
Or you could run up and get done up

[Damian Marley]
Or get something that you want none of
Unlimited amount you collect from us
Direct from us, street intellectuals

 
And I'm shrewd about decimals
And my man'll speak Patois
And I can speak rap star
Y'all feel me even if it's in Swahili
habari gani

[Damian Marley]
nzuri sana
Switch up the language and move to Ghana

 
Salute and honor, real revolution rhymers

[Damian Marley]
Rhythm piranhas

 
Like true Obamas, unfold the drama

 
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

[Damian Marley]
Queens to Kingston
Gunshot we use and govern the kingdom

Rise of the Winston, I can see the fear up in your eyes
Realize you can die any instant

[Damian Marley]
And I can hear the sound of a voice
When you must lose your life like mice in the kitchen

 
Snitching, I can see him pissing on hisself
And he's wetting up his thighs and he trying to resist it

[Damian Marley]
Switching, I can smell him digging up shit like a fly
Come around and be persistent

 
That's how you end up in a hitlist

[Damian Marley]
Ain't no bad man business

 
No evidence

[Damian Marley]
Crime scene, fingerprint-less

 
Flow effortless

[Damian Marley]
Casual like the weekends

 
No pressure when

[Damian Marley]
We're comfy and decent

 
We set this off beasting

[Damian Marley]
Hunting season

 
And, frankly speaking...
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it
Word is out, hysteria you heard about
Nas and Jr. Gong gonna turn it out
Body the verse until they scream "murder" out
The kings is back, time to return the crown
Who want it? Tuck your chain, we're due coming
Renegades that'll peel you back like new hundreds
Bet your jewels on it, you don't want to lose on it
Either move on or move on it

feat. K'naan)

[Chorus 1    - Jr. Gong x2]
Tribal war
We nuh want no more a dat 
Every man deserve to earn 
And every child deserve to learn, now 

Tribal war 
A nuh dat we a defend 
Every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn 

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Man what happened to us? 
Geographically they moved us 
From africa 
We was once happiness pursuers 
Now we back stabbing, combative and abusive 
The african and arab go at it they most muslim 
Used to be moving in unison 
Disputes would end 
Bounty hunters and grape street get cool again 
Some standard housing 
Got the young running rampant 
Wilding, for a phantom 
He can style in 
Mask on his face 
Grabbing his luger 
Saying, 'gnobody move or I'll shoot ya'
Man you're expiring 
Catch 25 and he does it like a man 
He sides with black, 
White pride and mexican 
Survive the best he can 
Strap a shank to his thigh 
Why do we all collide? 
Why do the young die? 
Extortion, murder and burglary 
Tattoos his chest 
Says his enemies don't deserve to breathe

[Chorus 2 - Jr. Gong x2]
Tribal war 
We nuh want no more a dat 
Everyone deserve to earn 
And every child deserve to learn, lord 

Tribal war 
A nuh dat we a defend 
Each and every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn 

[Verse 2 - K'Naan]
I drink poison 
Then I vomit diamonds 
I gave you mandela, black dalai lamas 
I gave you music 
You enthused in my kindness 
So how dare you reduce me to donny imus 
Timeless in case we never been acquainted 
Flyness who made it 
It gets duplicated 
Mindless violence 
Well let me try to paint it 
Here's the 5 steps 
In hopes to explain it 
One! 
Its me and my nation against the world 
Two! 
Then me and my clan against the nation 
Three! 
Then me and my fam' against the clan 
Four! 
Then me and my brother we no hesitation 
Uh! 
Go against the fam' until they cave in 
Five! 
Now who's left in this deadly equation? 
That's right, it's me against my brother 
Then we point a kalashnikov 
And kill one another 

[Chorus 3 - Jr. Gong x2]
Tribal war 
We nuh want no more a dat 
Everyone deserve to earn 
And every child deserve to learn 

Tribal war 
A nuh dat we a defend 
Every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn 

[Verse 3 - Jr. Gong]
Man a war tribal 
Over colors 
Over money, over land, and over oil, and over god 
And over idols, and even lovers 
Over breakfast, over dinner, over suppers 
Over jungle, over rema, over buckers 
Over brooklyn, over queens, and over rutgers 
Over red, and over blue, and over chuckers 
Over red and over blue and under covers 
Tribal trouble 
The drive by s double 
Cause the youth dem nah go war 
And go fight with knuckle 
The two sides scuffle 
Vietnam nah go a war 
With no more kung fu nun chuckle 
Missile and shuttle 
Huh 
And the queen of england and uncle sam 
Dem a flex dem muscle 
The tribal hustle 
Blood diamond poodle 
Survival struggle 

[Chorus 4 - Jr. Gong x2]
Tribal war 
We nuh want no more a dat 
Everyone deserve to earn 
Every child deserve to learn 

Tribal war 
A nuh dat we a defend 
Each and every man deserve a turn 
Like a flame deserve to burn

[Nas - Speaking:]
All I do is stay focused looking straight forward at the world and beyond. 
I feel people pulling me down. 
I feel some pulling me up I can't get stuck. 
I just keep moving forward. 
I got places to go man. Let's go... 

[CHORUS 1x - Damian Marley]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread 
A lot of weak are to weep and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
do you have it in you? 
Come we've got a journey to go 
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
I know you have it in you 
I know you have it in you 

[Damian Marley]
Hey.. The victory's found in truth, 
like innocence found in youth 
Self defeat is your own dispute 
and man you put yourself in a ya own shoeses Either you're winning or losing 
don't you get it confused 
Tay you starring in a ya own movie 
playing of a role you choose so
Stand up and fight if you know say you're right and no you won't ever fail 
Tipping the scale and the wind shall prevail and the boat shall forever sail 
(hey) There ain't no s ping or cruising
even when you're battered and bruised 
Hold gun all di sprinklers and he tell him bust my gat tougher than Zeus 

[CHORUS 1x - Damian Marley]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread 
A lot of weak are to weep and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
do you have it in you? 
Come we've got a journey to go 
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
I know you have it in you 
I know you have it in you 

 
As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death New York to Cali for the money, power, respect 
It's a journey, some'll get left behind coz in life you cannot press rewind 
Get it right. 
You only have one first chance to make one first impression that lasts a lifetime 
Reputations to proceed itself do you believe in hell? 
Babylon, greed for wealth Do you deceive yourself and let your ego swell 
And disregard those who most need your help 
Thick skinned, the dark won't take my soul Survived spiritual wars, see my welts 
And the evils felt but faith is stronger 
I saw grown men fall when I was a youngster 
But I clenched my fist 
Ready to go against whoever Tie my Timb's and rise in the end 

[CHORUS 1x - Damian Marley]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread 
A lot of weak are to weep and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
do you have it in you? 
Come we've got a journey to go 
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
I know you have it in you 
I know you have it in you 

[Damian Marley]
No man live forever 
but never say never 
Every goodie want better, 
just be a go getter 
And always be clever 
in every endeavour 
Coz drastic time call for drastic measure 
Your girl try to pleasure 
from ya neighbours things severe 
The land and the treasure 
work for whatever 
Jah say don't be a beggar, 
the alpha omega 
Will bless every soul no matter 
which name you prefer 
The immortal stepper 
believe in every skin 
no matter which colour they are 
Will never let you down no matter 
which kind of weather 
You're destined to rise like the son of Rebecca don't s  for a second 
Every man reckon 
it sure would be good to be there 
Whether Zion or Mecca 
when the gates are finally closed 
And the saints go marching in 

[CHORUS 2x - Damian Marley]
When the Armageddon's dark and dread 
A lot of weak are to weep and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
do you have it in you? 
Come we've got a journey to go 
And when the battle get sour and dread
A lot of weak are to wither and moan 
Only the strong will continue 
I know you have it in you 
I know you have it in you 

[Nas - Talk:]
As the weak shall fall to the sideline 
I get my kid 
I protect mine with a tech 9 
Haters want me to side with em 
Gangsters want me to ride with em 
Ladies want me to make brides with em 
I'm on a low I'm in the zone every evening 
I'm in the zone every evening walk through the valley of death 
I'm still breathing 
Give a bit of life to your ethylene 
Thief in the night like 
America seen 
Coming through in the zone every evening 
In the zone every evening 
I know the strong will survive

[VERSE 1 - Nas]
Yeah!
Got out the 600
Blunted
Chicks hunt him
Neighborhood know he comin'
Jakes hate him
Snakes could not violate him
Pimps memorize his lines-verbatim
He reps N.Y. yo
Gives C-notes to winos
Not church
It's how he tithe though
He walks the tenement
Sleeps at his super fly condo
My kinda nigga
My Icon, my Idol
No certificate
For this misfit who handle business
The odds stacked against him
He fights back mackin Benzes
Never puts cash or ass
Before friendship
He laughs last?
As some die young
He is still existing
Somehow he got around the pitfalls of the system
When he walks we watch
When he talks we listen
Leaders

[CHORUS 2 - Stephen Marley]
This one's for all the leaders

Lets all change the world
Change the world
This one's for all the leaders

[VERSE 2 - JR. GONG]
Who do I follow?
Who do I copy?
Look in to the mirror
And it's you I see look at me
Everything new
Like it fresh from the factory
Everything you do?
It impact me
Your lifestyle attract me
Parents try distract me
When I grow up
I want to be like you exactly
And as soon as I get over this acne
There's no way anybody coulda s  me
Me gravitate toward the aura
And all the mannerism
The sending out of orders
And man start moving busy
The locking of the corners?
The streets and all the buildings
Mi love you like a father
Mi ready and mi willing
Anything what you a talk
Is law in my dominion
And mi have similar thoughts
I share the same opinions
Mi have it say you smart
With mi best interest at heart
I'm following your path
Yow mine whe you a walk

[CHORUS 3 - Stephen Marley]
This one's for all the leaders

[VERSE 3 - Nas]
They appeal to the conscious
The Paramount
The Cesar, the monsters
The grandiose, the matters
The hell on earth pompous
Ellsworth Bumpy Johnsons
The Harlemites the Garveyites
Black as the credit card we swipe
Poppin' Dom tonight
For all of mine
I can see myself back at the Autobahn
Malcolm on the podium
Shells drop to linoleum
Swipe those
Place 'em on display at the Smithsonian
Next to only gems
That were left behind
By holy men
Infectious
Charisma of those who gave us direction
The anti-sexes
Resistance against oppression
Progressive thinking
Ghetto speakers
Protestors against the colored
Only section to the Jena 6 and
The Frost Nixon
The contradiction
The cross the crucifixion
The loss we took for sinning
On Esau's back inscription
That it was written
That nothing is coincidence'n
They took our leaders and they lynched them

[CHORUS 4 - Stephen Marley]
This one's for all the leaders
Leader
Lets all change the world

As I watch your children grow
And the years them carry on
And I miss you even more
Still I send them go to school
And tell them

When him couldn't catch a flew
Picka T you a mi don
Respect long and overdue
When nothing never did a gwan
You still have on somethin' new
Our friendship ever last
All when one minus from few
Yes we surely had a blast
We're like family Me and you
A nuh every path you cross
Lead to somebody whe true
Of the many that are called
Only chosen is a few

[Chorus 2 - JR. Gong]
Of the real friends that serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain
Your real friends will serve you long
Acquaintances will fade
Your real friends wont do you wrong

Only talking with winners
A loser or two

Still they think they real
But they just really awfully bitter
Salty niggaz Hate the smarter ones
These are the doubters
Who's our 'bout my run
I barely made it out the slums
My value high Cause I do more than
Rap about a gun
I made money for niggaz
Ya'll never looking out for none
I helped millionaires get to that very position
Some real millionaires see that's ill
Cause look at statistics
Real millionaires
And I ain't talking ghetto riches
Thorough business
You mistreating niggaz
Heard your folks bleed in prison
You ain't a G
And if you was
I don't recall
Who would roll with ya'll
Bunch a f*cking know it alls
Who's dough is small
Look what's it come to
Our rapport's good no more
We was good before
Till I saw what type a dude you took me for
We had a chance to take paper down
What I took was more
Because of hatred
Opportunity wasted

[Chorus 3 - JR. Gong]
Your real friends will serve you long
Your car and clothes will fade
Your real friend wont do you wrong
Real friend don't change Eh

Your real friend won't run in war

Take to the enemies

Real friend will hear you out
No secret feelings
Real friends won't sell you out
No bargain pleading

Your real friends will serve you long
When all else fails

Keep your vision clear
Cause only a coward lives in fear

Got only real powerful niggaz here
Real men we have a code of ethics

No counting your homey pocket
Spare no expense for legal defense
If your homey locked up
No keeping tabs
On who was the last who looked out
Selfishness
That's a character flaw
No holding out
Yo what happened to the honor?
You're dealing with
Sensitive Pre-Madonna drama
Teflon love
For my dudes who solid

[Chorus 5 - JR. Gong]
Your real friends will serve you long

Respect is due
They care for me
Should I be down
Or even out
They're next to me
Hey

[Chorus Out - JR. Gong]
Your real friends will serve you long
Your memories might fade
Your real friends will serve you long
Sunshine or rain, hey
Your real friends will serve you long, woe ya woe
When all else fails
Real friends won't do you wrong
Real friend don't change
Real friend don't change
Real friend don't change
Real friend don't change



(with Damian Marley)


And I've got studios to write in (?)
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
But by force I'm suggesting
Ya count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That through all the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings

Cause yo this year, can't wait 'til it gets here
7/21/09, my first song will shine
And it's amazing I'm about to be raisin'
Another main man and like his dad they'll praise him
And some will hate him, just cause we buildin' a nation
Like Bob did with Damian
The world will embrace him, girls'll chase him
Forsee, they will not break him
And when I'm not around, you look for God and thank him

And I've got somewhere to dress for,
And I've got no need to stress for
And so I'll always put my best forth
And count my blessings

And they'll be no need for tissues
'Cause there will be no further issues
If you got someone who miss you,
Man, count your blessings.

I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That you are the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings

You wishin' you were sittin' in the   position
Picture perfect, nothing less 'cause you deserve it
Without the Hermes, you'd have a hurtin'
You knew that you was destined for greatness, for certain
You see the over-zealous, they be thirstin', caught up in emotion
You keepin' your composure like Gershwin
Songs by Earth Wind keep you in the zone, writing verses
So when your pocket's light, know that you have a heavy purpose

We've got Sunday school and daycare
We've got pension and welfare
And though not all will play the game fair
Still I count my blessings

I've joy in abundance
I've got life full of substance
I've got meetings and functions
So I count my blessings

I've got something to live for
I've got surplus to give more
And we're all welcome through His door
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That you are the disaster
We're still here together after
So I count my blessings

I think you lookin' too hard for it
With the double RR under your garage door
Appreciate the things you work hard for
Hey, count your blessings
Count your blessings
So don't be mad if you ain't fly y'all
You got the means to reach the level I'm on
You should know there's only one Nas y'all
But count your blessings, count your blessings

And I've got studios to voice in
And I've got news for rejoicing
Now a new sun is rising
I count my blessings
That I'm safe when I'm resting
Furniture in my nesting
But by force I'm suggesting
Ya count your blessings

I've got love and assurance
I've got new health insurance
And I've got strength and endurance
So I count my blessings

And give thanks to the master
That you are the disaster
We're still here together after
Better count your blessings










[African Choir Intro]

[Jr. Gong - Chorus 1]
Lord! 
This Spear, huh! 
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Nyabinghi 
Man a Mau Mau Warrior 
Despair, eh 
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear, hey

Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya

AND SUCH AND SUCH BEFORE ME 
Who all fought for the cause and 
This Spear, eh 
Enforcing all the laws 

[Nas - Verse 1]
The Master of the Masses 
One has power 
The other one lacks it 
Guns are power 
Controlled by assets 
Owned by financial forecasters 
Who are the Masters? 
They are the Gangsters 
They are the bankers 
The ones who tax us 
The Masses 
They are us 
The sheep, the people 
Divided in classes 
I go off like a Shite bomb 
And All ya'll see I'm on my 
War paint on my face, shit 
My nine mm on my waist, shit 
I'm a problem 
Shoot up your place shit 
Let a few go 
Then I get low 
Blazing Haze again 
The Masters, The Wall Street War Chiefs 
The Elitists Groups 
The Masses 
They pray to Jesus 
Saying he will see us through 
The Masters are the aristocratic 
The Masses 
Ask if the Most High 
Is On his way here 
I'm trying to stay clear 
My mind is my modern day Spear 

[Jr. Gong - Chorus 2]
Hey 
I say...
This Spear, huh! 
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a Gideon 
Man a Mau Mau Warrior 
Despair, eh 
Fear and desperation no depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear, hey 
Through the hands of time and cruel men 
It has slew more than a billion 
Despair, eh 
It keep on suppressing the humble man's opinion 

[Nas - Verse 2]
This lead into Swiss cheese 
When the 5th squeeze 
Mislead 
The media Misleads 
Scares you to the point 
Where you miss sleep 
With that said 
This lead with this Ruger 
And that shooter 
Sub-machine gun 
Ratta tat through you 
Copper  s, hollow points 
Will do ya something bad 
Our future 
Is Mislead 
Three strikes 
There's no school 
When a teacher strikes 
This economy 
This monopoly 
Get no job 
Just own your property 
Now it's back to 
What comes natural 
Must survive any how you have to 
Despair, Desperation 
But I have no fear 
When I hold This Spear 

[Intermission]

[Jr. Gong - Bridge]
Mek some bwoy know mi nah smile 
Cause this spear nah beg friends 
Man a run racket 
Man a run scheme 
Man a run race 
Man a run down Benz 
Can't trust a she nor we nor eye 
Inna contact lense 
Man a run from police 
And a run down wealth 
And dollars and nah mek sense 

[Jr. Gong - Verse 3]
So, 
Rise up to my defense 
Hollow pointed is my preference 
Should have been deterred 
Don't know what you heard 
Get referred 
By the wrong reference 
When this spear start dispense 
It a fly and a tear through fence 
Dismember your members 
And all of your limbs 
Body bust inna nuff segments 
Well, 
Man a run drugs 
Man a run risk 
Man all a run out a time and ends 
Man a run up and down 
And a run fi dem life 
And a run down this month rent 
Nutin' nah gwan a yard 
And food deh a road 
Then man hafi go touch pavement 
Despair was a tool 
That was used to enslave man 
And mek manservant 
Escape from Despair and Desperation 
Becomes more urgent 
Mankind needs to cleanse and wash out dem soul 
With spiritual detergent 
A distant army 
A distant relative 
Controlling the circumference 
And any man move with no permission 
They're feeling the circumstance of 

[Jr. Gong - Chorus 4]
This Spear, hey 
Shaka Zulu, Bobo Shanti, Man a, eh 
Man a Mau Mau Warrior 
Despair, eh! 
Fear of your recession and depression can't tarry ya 
This Spear, hey 
Inner city youth dem rise it up disguised as AK-47 
This Spear, eh! 
And anytime them clap it up the whole city level 
This Spear 
Like Burning Spear 
And such and such before I 
Who all fought for the cause and 
This Spear, eh! 
They can't ignore me 
No!

Imagine Ghana like California with Sunset Boulevard 
Johannesburg would be Miami 
Somalia like New York 
With the most pretty light 
The nuffest pretty car 
Ever New Year the African Times Square lock-off 
Imagine Lagos like Las Vegas 
The Ballers dem a Ball 
Angola like Atlanta 
A pure plane take off 
Bush Gardens inna Mali 
Chicago inna Chad 
Magic Kingdom inna Egypt 
Philadelphia like Sudan 
The Congo like Colorado 
Fort Knox inna Gabon 
People living in Morocco like the state of Oregon 
Algeria warmer than Arizona bring your sun lotion 
Early morning class of Yoga on the beach in Senegal 
Ethiopia the capitol of fi di Congression 
A deh so I belong 
A deh di The King come from 
I can see us all in limos 
Jaguars and B'mos 

[Dennis Brown]
Riding on the King's Highway

 
Promised Land I picture Porsches 
Basquiat Portraits 
Pinky Rings realistic princesses 
Heiresses bunch a Kings and Queens 
Plus I picture fortunes for kids out in Port-Au-Prince 
Powerless they not allowed to fit 
But not about to slip 
Vision Promised Land with fashion like 
Madison Ave Manhattan 
Saks 5th Ave and 
Rodeo 
Relaxing popping labels 
Promise Land no fables 
This where the truth's told 
Use them two holes 
Above your nose 
To see the proof yo! 
Imagine a contraption that could take us back when 
The world was run by black men 
Back to the future 
Anything can happen 
If these are the last days 
And 100-food waves come crashing down 
I get some hash and pounds 
Pass around the bud then watch the flood 
Can't s  apocalypse 
My synopsis is catastrophic 
If satellites is causing earthquakes 
Will we survive it 
Honestly man it's the sign of the times 
And the times at hand 

[Dennis Brown]
There's alot of work to be done, O gosh 
In the Promised Land




Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

Jah told you in his own words
And I'll see you through
To guide you through this cold world
And I'll see you through

[Verse 1 - Nas]
Two steps away from death, a vest and a holster
I detest detectives arresting us over
Weapons possession, they was checking the Rover
Inspecting the tattoos on my neck and my shoulder
How many times I'm one of six coffin-holders
Or sitting with goons in a visiting room
Flip it, I could've been you
Behind state walls bidding
These are the things that a G pray for, acquit us
A little stash in the safe or a little shorty to wait for
Or a shorty to take the weight for him
What really did I escape from?
Thought I saw God's face on the design on my vintage Claiborne
Swear I see em every day in the bus or the train
Or the billboards out there that hang tall
I still give thanks for him, have faith for him
No matter what his name's called

[Chorus - Jr. Gong]

[Verse 2 - Jr. Gong]
Hey can you think of a colour that you've never seen?
Can you reminisce on places you've never been?
Well is many are called
But them never deemed
Worthy for the cause
Cause them never clean
Help who help themselves
Jah nuh raffle dream
That's why me chummy with Jah Jah
Like a Cherubim
Keep us strong through the winter like an Evergreen
And all of us are more connected than it ever seems
All things are related and creation is a package
Generate together and we increase the wattage
A how them a go manage?
Tell Babylon them can't do Rasta damage
Nor s  we through the passage
Jah did make a promise, God is always honest
Always keep his word, don't care what the plan is
Don't be astonished
Stumbling bocks vanish
One day the meek gonna live inna di palace, Woah!

[Chorus - Jr. Gong]

[Verse 3 - Nas]
Some people ask me if I feel the zionists are real
And in my songs do I plan to expose and reveal
Word to the curb that's under these chrome wheels
My homies is only ones I'm taking care of
But severe reality starts to become more clear
And these know-it-all rappers have become more weird
As if they were superior and fans are inferior
How I balance between the streets and the theories of
Collegiate literature, I hold mirrors up
Give combinations of pain, joy, fear, and love
Through my perspective I can see Jah reflection
In the highest definition getting high with my brethren
Could've asked us why Africans dying from circumcision
They lack proper surgeons, suffer malnutrition
Underestimate the wealth of their own wisdom
It's like it's been exchanged for this penicillin

[Chorus - Jr. Gong]

Some of the smartest dummies
Can't read the language of Egyptian mummies
An' a fly go a moon
And can't find food for the starving tummies
Pay no mind to the youths
Cause it's not like the future depends on it
But save the animals in the zoo
Cause the chimpanzee dem a make big money
This is how the media pillages
On the TV the picture is
Savages in villages
And the scientist still can't explain the pyramids, huh
Evangelists making a living on the videos of ribs of the little kids
Stereotyping the image of the images
And this is what the image is
You buy a khaki pants
And all of a sudden you say a Indiana Jones
An' a thief out gold and thief out the scrolls and even the buried bones
Some of the worst paparazzis I've ever seen and I ever known
Put the worst on display so the world can see
And that's all they will ever show
So the ones in the west
Will never move east
And feel like they could be at home
Dem get tricked by the beast
But a where dem ago flee when the monster is fully grown?
Solomonic linage whe dem still can't defeat and them coulda never clone
My spiritual DNA that print in my soul and I will forever Own Lord

Huh, we born not knowing, are we born knowing all?
We growing wiser, are we just growing tall?
Can you read thoughts? can you read palms?
Huh, can you predict the future? can you see storms, coming?
The Earth was flat if you went too far you would fall off
Now the Earth is round if the shape change again everybody woulda start laugh
The average man can't prove of most of the things that he chooses to speak of
And still won't research and find out the root of the truth that you seek of
Scholars teach in Universities and claim that they're smart and cunning
Tell them find a cure when we sneeze and that's when their nose start running
And the rich get stitched up, when we get cut
Man a heal dem broken bones in the bush with the wed mud
Can you read signs? can you read stars?
Can you make peace? can you fight war?
Can you milk cows, even though you drive cars? huh
Can you survive, Against All Odds, Now?

Who wrote the Bible? Who wrote the Qur'an?
And was it a lightning storm
That gave birth to the earth
And then dinosaurs were born? damn
Who made up words? who made up numbers?
And what kind of spell is mankind under?
Everything on the planet we preserve and can it
Microwaved it and try it
No matter what we'll survive it
What's hu? what's man? what's human?
Anything along the land we consuming
Eatin', deletin', ruin
Trying to get paper
Gotta have land, gotta have acres
So I can sit back like Jack Nicholson
Watch niggas play the game like the lakers
In a world full of 52 fakers
Gypsies, seances, mystical prayers
You superstitious? throw salt over your shoulders
Make a wish for the day cuz
Like somebody got a doll of me
Stickin' needles in my arteries
But I can't feel it
Sometimes it's like 'pardon me, but I got a real big spirit'
I'm fearless.... I'm fearless
Don't you try and grab hold of my soul
It's like a military soldier since seven years old
I held real dead bodies in my arms
Felt their body turn cold, oh
Why we born in the first place
If this is how we gotta go?
Damn.

My generation will make a change

(Yes we will) 
My generation will make a change 
This generation will make a change 
(Do You hear me now) 
My generation will make a change 
This generation will make a change 
(we bout to make a change) 

Now mi love fi see the schoolas dem a graduate 
A study hard and save the party for the holidays 
Diplomatic with dem Diploma 
And them bound fi great 
Because dem nah pick up no matic and a perpetrate 
And then I love the energies whe dem a generate 
My Generation it so special it will make a change 
Because the elders sew the seed and it a germinate 
So anytime dem see the progress dem a celebrate 
Because we rising up despite of the economy 
And then a we a star the show like the astronomy 
And how we keep on breaking through is an anomaly 
Because we keep remaining true without apology 
The mission ha to carry through and finish properly 
Say Gambia to Guadeloupe Paris to Napoli 
Say Zambia to Honolulu back to Tripoli 
And everybody want a future living happily 

Can you blame my generation, subjected gentrification, 
Depicting their frustrations over ill instrumentation 
Cause music is the way to convey to you what I'm facing, 
Placing my life in front of your eyes for your observation 
Now if you can't relate then maybe you are too complacent, 
Athletes today are scared to make Muhammad Ali statements 
Whats up with your motto? 
Will you lead? Will you follow? 
Improve your values 
Education is real power 
I reach em like Bono 
So get rid of your self sorrow 
Add some bravado 
Get wealthy likes Wells Fargo 
Its truth, that I am you 
And I am proof 
Surviving through 
We do what we gotta do 
Yo we could break the cycle let nobody lie to you 
Then maybe put our sons and our daughters in private school 
Cause there's a mission we gotta finish before we leave 
This generation is destined to do historic deeds. 

uhh if you weather that storm 
Then that rain bring sun 
Been a long time comin 
I know change gone come 
Man I gotta keep it movin to the beat of my drum 
Last night I set the future at the feet of my son 
But they thinkin that my generation gotta die young 
If we all come together then they cant divide one 
Don't worry bout it just be about it 
Got a message from god heaven too crowded 
But I say hey young world you've never looked betta 
And I heard change started with man in the mirror ughh 
This generation 
I'mma represent 
A generation led by a black president 
Now hows that for change 
Who knew that could change 
I don't even look at the flag the same hey ughhh 
So when you finish readin revelations 
Thank god for my generation 

Morning to you man
Morning to you love
Hey, I say I say

[Chorus 2x]
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today

[Nas: Verse 1]
The black oasis
Ancient Africa the sacred 
Awaken the sleeping giant
Science, Art is your creation
I dreamt that we could visit Old Kemet
Your history is too complex and ridig
For some western critics
They want the whole subject diminished
But Africa's the origin of all the world's religions
We praised bridges that carried us over
The battle front of Sudanic soldiers
The task put before us

[Chorus 2x]

[Nas: Verse 2]
Who are we today?
The slums,deceases, AIDS
We need all that to fade
We cannot be afraid 
So who are we today?
We are the morning after
The make shift youth
The slave ship captured
Our Diaspora, is the final chapter
The ancetral lineage built pyramids
Americas first immigrant
The Kings sons and daughters from Nile waters
The first architect, the first philosophers, astronomers
The first prophets and doctors was 

[Bridge: Jr.Gong]
Now can we all pray
Each in his own way
Teaching and Learning
And we can work it out
We'll have a warm bed
We'll have some warm bread
And shelter from the storm dread
And we can work it out
Mother Nature feeds all
In famine and drought
Tell those selfish in ways
Not to share us out
What's a tree without root
Lion without tooth
A lie without truth
you hear me out


Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May a better day come
Yesterday we were Kings
Can you tell me young ones
Who are we today
Ye lord
Africa must wake up
The sleeping sons of Jacob
For what tomorrow may bring
May some more love come
Yesterday we were Kings
I'll tell you young blood
This world is yours today

Oh ye people restless in the refusal of peace
and when a man chooses religion, aren't you the one's to kill him?
and when a country is built, aren't you the one's to tear it down?
and when one attempts to tell the truth, aren't you the one's to cut him down?
Who are we today?
Morning to you
Morning to you man
Morning to you love

Space and sea

This is rock and roll meets aristotle
I fly those g5's through the skies to cabbo
Martial arts more ancient than tabbo
Schwartzman, more ancient than zorro
Ancient like the pharohs or priests of yoruba
Maher rabah-nasr is the best
Them paths like climbing mount kiliminjaro
Ancient men traded cattle
Before columbus was lost in travel, ancient canoes got paddeled
Before the horse saddle there was camel
Spears before arrow, arrow before ammo
Tribal paint before camoflage
Chief before sarge, our lieutenant
Village elders before senates
Used to sail the seas before the compass was invented
Ancient people spoke free, they didn't need a 1st amendment
In the beginning, the drum was the tech cendent
There was moons before months, and time before minutes

Ayyo, Queens get the money, niggas still screaming paper chase.
But presidential candidates is planning wars with other nations, over state with Masons.
Pregnant teens give birth to intelligent gangsters, they daddy's faceless.
Play this by your stomach, let my words massage it and rub it.
I be his daddy if no one is there to love it.
Tell him his name Nasir, tell him how he got here.

Mama was just having fun with someone above her years.
Niggas is still hating.
Talking that Nas done fell off with rhyming, he rather floss with diamonds.
They pray, "Pleased God, let him spit that oozie in the army lining. "
That shorty do-op rolling ooh-ops in the park reclining.
Take 27 emcee's, put them in a line and they out of alignment.

















From Willie Lynch to Willie Hutch
Right on
We superfly
Made Gucci this shit, Louie too
Suits and ties
Player trophies
Pray to Goldie
Picture wax museums full of Black Panther triple OGs
Aunt Jemima hos
Historic horse shit
Girls from long time ago
Stagecoach with the horse, kid
Witch doctors
Good old pickpockets
Sip moonshine
So-called coons, shines and darkies
I love ya'll
Pyramids to cotton fields to Wrigley Fields
Forgotten men who didn't get killed
Christmas addicts
The first blast and peace to the rich lady
Purse snatcher shot in the back
I know your hunger, kid
I know they hung your dad
Burnt your mama crib
I know that hurt you bad
Mystery shows
From gold to shackles and back to gold
We act like we home
Matter fact, we are home
Bad attitudes
Octaroon skin tones
Slave food turned to soul food
Collards and neck bones
Betsy Ross sewed the first American flag
Bet she had a nigga with her to help her old ass

As James Baldwin says
You can only be destroyed by believing
That you really are what the white world considers
A nigger

No matter how hard you try
You can't s  us now

Can't be s ped
Yo on Dateline
The other night they showed hate crimes
Gave a Blood time
Cause he fought with his canine
Bestiality
Humane Society
Go to China, see how they dine
See what they eat
Better yet ask PETA whoever
Which animal makes suede
If not for suede would you have survived the Dark Ages?
Cannibal ways of the anti-Caucasians
Still you like your steak tartar
Pinot noir
David Starr on the chain of Sammy Davis
He helped pave the way for Southern crankers and them Harlem shakers
Now we getting our papers
And try to censor the words
To s  our money coming
But you can't escape us
Haters



    
And America ya never be free
Middle fingers up, f*ck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

Bravehearts still QB's Finest
Grindin', enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shinin'
You can see a nigga breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

Jewels enchanted, like they was new from Atlantis
Cruise with the hammer
Jealous hearted can't stand him
Haters are scandalous
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

To all my niggas getting money in the streets
Middle fingers up, f*ck the police
Light up my tress
And I just breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

I twist em
Baby mama beat victim
Chronic leaf hittin'
All kinds of heat with him, wisdom
From pot to piss in to high position
Intense hustle, is pain like a pinched muscle
Till it rains and my Timbs stain my socks
Till I dodge enough shots
And the presiding judge slams a mallot
It's his life I'm a gwop
Then I copp
Then I yacht
Then I dot
Island hoppin' away from nightmare holders
Or cowboys slingers
Who shoot up any club
To see their names ring loud on some FBI poster
Must be on X or he coked up
Suggestin' I post a, bail
I'm like yes 'cause we soldiers
We just gettin' older
In time, we still in our prime
I can't afford a new arrest in my folder
Nigga breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

And America ya never be free
Middle fingers up, f*ck the police
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

Bravehearts still QB's Finest
Grindin', enough diamonds to change the climate
Not only do you see a nigga shinin'
You can see a nigga breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

Jewels enchanted, like they was new from Atlantis
Cruise with the hammer
Jealous hearted can't stand him
Haters are scandalous
Damn, can't a nigga just breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

To all my niggas getting money in the streets
Middle fingers up, f*ck the police
Light up my tress
And I just breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)

I'm fresh out of city housing
It had to many options
Pennies on the pension or penitentiary bounded
Plenty Henny in me
Envy was simply they trend see
My enemy was every hater that was bigger than me

The high life, the fly life
Pierre Hardy, imitation of Christ
Icewear gaudy, since '94 flossy
The Lex was an excellent choice
Now fast forward me
The pestilence of the ghetto informed me
As a shorty, to push nothin' less than a 740
With fresh linen
Sip pellegrinos with airs on
They sick, mixing their water with airbourne

Oh they so sick!
Look how I got them all crazy, look at that!
You gotta let it out. Stress ain't good man!
You gotta breathe (breathe, breathe, breathe)
(America we gotta be free)

(Breathe, breathe, breathe) [x4]




Lace the nations don't have it
A hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns
When I'm around
Or I'm wasting the fabric
I don't feel greater
To my plush pieces
'Cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-mugging on my clean-thugging
Mean nothing
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin
The black poetry-writing Russian
Ice disgusting
I started bling
How could you question my direction
Or my time for collection
Gangstas two-steppin'
You hate me
Should thank me
But lately
I burned so much trees
I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder
Your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all living trendy on pennies
I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower   floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we riding heavy
And why to Miami? 'Cause ... .
(We make the world go round)
Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas.
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us.
(We make the world go round)
I see you haters on the floor jockin my swag
I'm popping Ralph Lauren tags
I'm pouring champagne inside a polo glass
Model b'tches rollin grass
Escabon folding cash
Toasting with my entourage
Went for Robin Armitage
To all my stars
Red carpet to the Larmitage
We throwin red dice
At the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini
Or twenties out my garage
Instead of shopping South Beach like - and Terror Squad
We the Best! big pippin
  down chrome spinnin
  Gun Tom Cruise
Tucked inside my Gucci linen
No
Jess Romo you tryin' a shine
Up on with the nine
On your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson that's so-so
Nick warner's baby back
With - lo so.
Devil white
5-0 they catch me at the pro bowl on the field diamonds
Choking the jockey on my
Polo
CB let em know though
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas.
(We make the world go round)
Tell the gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us.
(We make the world go round)
We make the world go round From my town to your town
We on   no s ping us now
We got patron to ballers two steppin
Ladies on the float and all in two steppin
From Malay to Harlem two stepping [echo]
So I' s  cause we made it where the ladies are

We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
A-life tag popper
It'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a 100 cash, shopping
Balance only would hafta
Hafta to swell you up
Before a pea snaps as you wet a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet
Bet that, 300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
  down, new fashion
Seeing me is like seeing through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera
Light flashing, and I'm laughin'
My plaque's from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum
But .99 cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what!
Now let's toast to the hustlers
(We make the world go round)
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas.
(We make the world go round)
Tell them gangstas, toast to the ballers
(We make the world go round)
And tell the ballers pour glass for all us.
(We make the world go round)


    
Chain gleaming
Switching lanes
Two-seating
Hate him or love him
For the same reason
Can't leave it
The games needs him
Plus the people need someone to believe in
So in God's Son we trust
'Cause they know I'm gonna give 'em what they want
They looking for... a hero
I guess that makes me... a hero

Another chapter of the cleanest rapper
Distinguished gentlemen
Crooks and castle on his back
Maybach-er, exotic lady eye-catcher
Holla at'cha, call me the chiropractor
Working like Muay Thai class
Get perspire out ya
And of course I've been the boss since back when
Rocking D Boy, Fila, velour in a 190 black Benz
Now they shut down the stores when I'm shopping
Used to be train robbing, face covered in stocking
I'm him



Rubber-grip-holder, reloader
Come at me I'm a rip your soldiers in half
Silver back ape, nickel-plated mag
Young, rich, and flashy
Young, bitch, I'm nasty
All black clothes till ice lay on me so classy
And every time I close my lids
I can still see the borough, I can still see the Bridge
I can still see the dreams that my niggas ain't never lived to see
Tell them angels open the door for me
From nine Berrettas and moving raw
To chilling in wine cellars
Sticks and humidors
That's what I call mature
That's what I call a g
That's what I call a pimp
That's what I call a gangsta
To the fullest, shit
I try to make more cream
By every September 14th, that's my dream
So I can be more clean, as I grow yearly
I can see things more clearly
That's why they fear me



This universal apartheid
I'm hog-tied, the corporate side
Blocking y'all from going to stores and buying it
First L.A. and Doug Morris was riding with it
But Newsweek article startled big wigs
They said, Nas, why is he trying it?
My lawyers only see the Billboard charts as winning
Forgetting - Nas the only true rebel since the beginning
Still in musical prison, in jail for the flow
Try telling Bob Dylan, Bruce, or Billy Joel
They can't sing what's in their soul
So untitled it is
I never change nothin'
But people remember this
If Nas can't say it, think about these talented kids
With new ideas being told what they can and can't spit
I can't sit and watch it
So, shit, I'm a drop it
Like it or not
You ain't gotta cop it
I'm a hustler in the studio
Cups of Don Julio
No matter what the CD called
I'm unbeatable, y'all


[Talking: Nas]
Yo... it's like waking up from a bad dream
Just to figure out you weren't dreaming in the first place

 
If all I saw was gangsters
Coming up as a youngster
Pussy and money the only language I clung ta
Claim ta, unrolled myself up to become one
Ain't ya happy I chose rap
I'm amongst tha
Streets deceiving
Can't believe my achievements
Cultural strata
Persona's that of a non-needer
Because I don't need nada except for Prada beaver
For cold winters, tattoos got my summer's sleeveless
To my g's on the flee from the coppers
Stiff bodies on freeze in funeral parlors
From the slums I come up a phoenix
Caked up, tryna take what I'm eating
Came up a dismissive kid
You lucky if you allowed to witness this
Savvy mouth
Wild, hardly
A man's man
Who woulda knew the beach houses and wild parties
Jezebel's and Stella McCartney's
For years, all that
How could I not be dead
This old German
Said I was a thug with a notty head
Looked at my Benz and called that a Nazi sled
With a face like he wonder where I got my bread
Probably all these stones he see
From my shows overseas
From crime to rhyme
My stories is I'm from the home of the thieves

  
Blessed
The lord is a g, he gotta be
Who's the God of suckers and snitches
The economy
Lipstick from Marilyn Monroe
Blew a death kiss to Fidel Castro
He'd want me to spit this
Only the strong survive
Nas bear witness
The hypocrisy is all I can see
White cop acquitted for murder
Black cop cop a plea
That type of shit make me s  and think
We in chronic need of a second look of the law books
And the whole race dichotomy
Too many rappers, athletes, and actors
But not enough niggas in NASA
Who give you the latest dances, trends, and fashion
But when it comes to residuals, they look past us
Woven into the fabric, they can't stand us
Even in white tee's, blue jeans, and red bandanas

   
Assassinations
Diplomatic relations
Killed indigenous people
Built a new nation
Involuntary labor
Took a knife split a woman naval
Took her premature baby
Let her man see you rape her
If I could travel to the 1700's
I'd push a wheelbarrow full of dynamite
Through your covenant
Love to sit in on the Senate
And tell the whole government
Y'all don't treat women fair
She read about herself in the bible
Believing she the reason sin is here
You played her, with an apron
Like bring me my dinner, dear
She the nigger here
Ain't we in the free world
Death penalty in Texas kill young boys and girls
Barbarity, I'm in the double-R casually
Bugging how I made it out the hood, dazzle me
How far we really from third world savagery
When the empire fall, imagine how crazy that'll be





[Intro:]
So we look at what's going on - this as an EXTREME aggression, um
I'm also hearing about it from EVERYWHERE!
It's-it's on the islands, it's on the continent, it's here: it's everywhere!
And this is, if you will, a WAR - An all out assault by...

    
The sly fox
Cyclops
We locked
In the idiot box
The video slots
Broadcast
The Waco Davidian plots
They own YouTube, Myspace
When this ignorant shit gon' s ?
They monopolizing news
Your views
And the channel you choose
Propaganda
Visual cancer
The eye
In the sky
Number five
On the dial
Secret agenda
Frequency antenna
Doctor mind bender
Remote control
Soul
Controller
Your brain holder
Slave culture
Game's over
What's a Fox characteristic?
Slick shit
Sensin'
Misinformation
Pimp the station
Over stimulation
Reception
Deception
Comcast digital Satan
The Fox has a bushy tail
And Bush tells
Lies and Foxtrots
So I don't know what's real

    
Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
S  sleeping
Start thinking
Outside of the box and
Unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Big Brother is watchin'

Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
S  sleeping
Start thinking
Outside of the box and
Unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Fox 5 is watchin'

    
The Fear Factor got you all rattled up
O' Reilly
Oh really?
No rally needed
I'll tie you up
Network for child predators, settin' 'em up
Myspace pimps, hoes, and sluts
Ya'll exploit rap culture, then ya'll flip on us
And you own the post, and ya'll shit on us
What is they net worth?
They gon' try to censor my next verse?
Throw 'em off the roof neck first
While I'm clicking my cursor
Reading blogs about the pressure they put on Universal
It gets worse while I'm clicking my mouse
While they kickin' my house
They figured us out
Why a nigga go south
It's either he caught a body, no sleep they watchin'!
I watch CBS
And I See B.S.!
Tryin' to track us down with GPS
Make a nigga wanna invest in PBS

    
Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
S  sleeping
Start thinking
Outside of the box and
Unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Big Brother is watchin'

Watch what you watchin'
Fox keeps feeding us toxins
S  sleeping
Start thinking
Outside of the box and
Unplug from The Matrix doctrine
But watch what you say Fox 5 is watchin'

    
They say I'm all about murder-murder and kill-kill
But what about Grindhouse and Kill Bill?
What about Cheney and Halliburton? (Halliburton?)
The backdoor deals
On oil fields
How's NaS the most violent person?
Ya'll don't know talent if it hit you
Bringin' up my criminal possession charges with a pistol (pistol)
I use Viacom
As my firearm
And let the lyrics split you
Who do you rely upon?
They shoot shells at Leviathan
I'm dealing with the higher form
F*ck if you care how I write a poem?
Only Fox that I love was the red one
Only black man that Fox loves is in jail or a dead one!
Red rum
Political bedlam
Don't let the hype into your eyes and ear drum
Murdoch on Fox
Not 18 with Barracas
And he hate Barack cause
He march with the marchers

[Outro:]
I pledge allegiance to the fair and balanced truth.
Not the biased truth
Not the liar's truth
But the highest truth
I will not be deceived
Nor will I believe
In the Propaganda
I will not fall for the Okey-Doke
I am tuned-in

[NaS:]
Watch, cause they're watching
Watch what you're watching

Better watch, cause they're watching
Watch what you're watching

Me-Me-Media
Misleading ya

Watch what you're watching






 
I just burnt my american flag
And sent 3 cracker nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh I'm loadin teffs in my mag
To send these redneck biggots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans that live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me a united states murderer

Would you testify you buy my songs you buy my songs but would you ride with me

  
You understand my struggle that's what u claim right
And get your aim right
And get your game tight
Don't buy my songs you don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing ho and shit
F*ck y'all little little ho bitches
I don't need you I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloadin it
Like I'm your man who be exposed an shit
Like a william cooper
Who told you the pale horse is the future

Would you testify with some realness like that I think you scared I don't think you prepared you know what I'm asking you do you know what I'm asking you






    
They say we N - I - Double G - E - R
We - are - much more,
Still we choose to ignore,
The obvious.
Man this history don't acknowledge us,
We was scholars long before colleges.

They say we N - I - Double G - E - R
We - are - much more,
But still we choose to ignore,
The obvious.
We are the slave and the master,
What you looking for?
You the question and the answer.

 
We trust no black leaders,
Use the stove to heat us,
Powder eggs and government cheeses,
The calendar was Martin, JFK, & Jesus,
Gotta be fresh
Go to school with fly sneakers.
Schools with outdated books,
We are the forgotten,
Summers coolin' off by the fire hydrant.
Yeah I'm from the ghetto,
Where old black women talk about they sugar level,
It's not unusual,
To see photos of dead homies' funerals,
Aluminum foil on t.v. antennas
Little TV sit on   the big TV eatin TV dinners,
Girls die they hair with kool-aid,
They gave us lemons we made lemonade,
But this nigga's paid,
Ancestry of slaves,
Descendant of Kings
It's necessary I,
Bling,
Puts rings on every thing
Where Timbs on every scene.



  
Do I mean it like a slave master?
NIGGER!
No!
I'm gangsta
Gotta eat rappers!
My abbreviation
Was young when I caught the cases,
That should mean the court could see my changes
Take off the bracelets,
Savage when broke,
Smoke sour diesel
Need no Bo-flex
My chest still cut-up like a bag of dope,
Thought patterns consist of boss matters,
Spit Moses' "Lost Commandments"
Like a gross sandwich out my mouth.
Toast to government cameras
Peepin us every week
I must have my cars homes & phones
Squeaked for bugs,
But this is what I was dreamin of,
Between cutting hard coke with new razors
Slicing my fingers up,
They use to string us up,
We wanted everything,
But the one bringing us cake be the snakes
Like the...
Like the New Jack City wedding scene
No time for mistakes trying to get it like [? ]



   
My nig...
Whattup my nig?
People afraid of criticism
But I always put myself in a sacrificial position!
They been know I ain't just rappin for fame,
I got my old homie [? ] the father asking for change!
Yep! I'd give this cash up
This paper don't matter
They seen me from skinny to fatter
When I rap about war,
They got the tendency to scatter,
They ain't my backup no more,
So now my enemies are at my front door,
Cause any time we mention
Our condition, our history or existence,
They calling it reverse racism,
Still till today the street's torn,
My brother Jungle always have a seat for 'em
Not behind me - beside me
You'll always know where to find me,
They say the close ones will hurt you,
So let's keep a small circle,
On the road to riches, and diamond rings
In the land of the blind
The man with one eye is the king.









No revolutionary gets old
Or so I'm told
You're left full of bullet-holes
When you tell the people go free
Oh, it's a matter of days before they try to take me
I heard gunshots rang
His bullet got my name
I ain't see him take aim
I dreamt this day came
'Cause I stood in the face of damnation
Satan, spat at him, flat out disgraced him
He want my blood; why me?
Why not the fake ones who deserve death, man
F*ck it, I'll take one
Can s  me but can't s  a whole nation
Of millions who feel you deceived them
They believing reparation makes it even
So I'm deadly now because of one reason
They listening
In Budapest, Japan, China, and Switzerland
We getting it in, son
Another bullet passed by-missed me
Wondering who plotting to get me
Alphabet boys still plotting against me
To hush me up and stuff me in the pockets of history
You won't remember why they came to clip me
When time go by, you'll soon forget me
They say he was the king of bling, jewels, and Bentley's
Then they use one of my lines just to prove I'm guilty
Don't let them kill me

Some revolutionaries do live long
Am I one of them? Guess we'll know in due time
Everybody has rights, can I use mine?
Can I rock shine? Can I have a girl that's too fine?
Got a swell life, tell me, will I lose mine?
Every time I turn around somebody new dying
Let's start living
Ala carte escargot, Escobar, invest my millions
Mansion for the wife, the rest for the children
Knowing that they coming any time, but until then
I'm at large until they shoot me
Million dollar stones and my camouflage Gucci
Giving you this crack like Pookie
To question the system
Be the resistance
No matter what color you are
Everybody nigga's
You can stand by and watch
Or you can march on with us










[Intro: NaS]
Uh, lo lo jaw
What I'm gonna do? (What I'm gonna do?)
Uh, shh, lo lo jaw
Ehahaha
Shit is all true

    
Mmm, Fried chicken
Fly vixen
Give me
Heart Disease
But need
You in my kitchen
You a bird, but you ain't a ki
Got wings but you can't fly away from me
Driving in your bucket seats
All the way from kentucky
To f*ck with me
Look what you've done to me?
Was number one to me!
After you shower
You and your gold medal flour
Then you rub on with hot oil for half an hour
You in your hot tub, I'm looking at you salivating
Dry you off, I got your paper towel waiting
Lay you down cause you're red hot
Louisiana style you make my head rot
Then I flock
To the bed then, "Plop"
When we done, I need rest
Don't know a part of you that I love best
Your legs or your breast
Misses Fried Chicken, you gon be a nigga's death
Created by southern black women
To serve massa, guest
You gon be a nigga's death
Misses Fried Chicken
You was my addiction
Dripping wet hot, coalesced
Like Greeks with their falafel
Or Italians with their to-mato
Pasta
Or roti is to a rasta
Trapping me
You and your friend mac and cheese
Candy yams and collard greens
Cut you knocking me to my knees
Was killing me when I miss, ah
Nothing I need more than a fish fry

[Verse 2: Busta Rhymes]
Shit, It taste good, I can't lie
It's like you're walking out a tanning saloon
When I pull you out the oven, from baking I got you on my mind
Rubbing that sun tan lotion all up over your body
So amazing, how you sparkle when I glaze you swine
Hey, my pretty hand hot, it's so feminine
The way you submitting
And how you gave me power
To messaging me to shower
You with lemon water
Marinate you with season you dipping you in chowder
Baby
It's like you at the spa
The way you gently
Lay in the pan
While you enjoying you butter milk treatment
I sit and watch the grease sizzle bubbling
On your skin
Despite the funny fragrance
Still I lick my finger frequent
In any event
I'm reflecting on all the signs saying that I got I shouldn't f*ck with you
But the way you taste made it hard to resist when I put my mouth on you
But that's another issue
Butterflies up in my stomach when I laid EYES on you
Was it infection manifesting?
Confused over the feeling impatiently eating you
Intestinal worm chewing on the walls of my intestine
I'm a eat you until there's nothing left
Til my very last breath
You gon be a nigga's death
Despite your good appearance
Cooking swine as a chef
You gon be a nigga's death
Who cares if the swine
Is mixed with rat, cat, and dog combined?
Yes, I eat the shit to death

[Outro: Busta Rhymes]
Ain't that some shit?
I'm a eat some shit
Until what I'm eating KILLS ME!

And I choose to do that
Why?
Cause that's just what niggas do

Hehehehe

ltl2('Nas','Fried Chicken')




It is absolutely silly and unproductive to have a funeral for the word nigger when the actions continue we need to have a movement to resurrect brothers and sisters not a funeral for niggers cause niggers don't die

[Verse:]
Ugh yeah yo I'm creepy and crawling
In your sink or your toilet
I'll be drinking from your spit
Anything cause I'm more less an insect with 4 legs
People come and I fake dead
Correction I got 8 legs
Climbin on   your plate bed
Where ever I smell food
It could even jail food
Stale food that's molded
A roach is what I am fool
The ghetto is my land fool
I'm a never be able to fly like a bumblebee

Try not to be underneath
Your sneaker
Pitiful creature
I'm not afraid of your pesticide
Or ray
Cause in heavens my creator
I love it when the lights off
Eating from same knives forks
From any mans dinner
See my antennas
You can't win
You can't stand the crunchy sound I make if you squash me
Learn to live with me
How much your roast? costing
You and the city
But yo we everywhere
Check your house I bet we there



 
Find a room to lock yourself in and close the door
It's some heavy concepts that we gotta explore
We gotta strip the word down rugged and raw
The rhetoric of martin king just saint around no more
Dave bowie ain't here james baldwin neither
They all were leaders
But they ain't help me get this porcsh two seater
A lawyer left the hood he never looked back
To be a fortune 500 ceo it took rap
So what if my pants sag with my hat turned back
The same swag got our merchandise flying off the rack
Marketing companies that's hiring blacks
Fresh hip hop lingo for your campaign ads
The controversy surrounds who could say it and win
Some niggas are full time some play and pretend
So f*ck that no apologies on the issue
If it offends you
It's meant to
It's that simple


Tryin to erase me from y'all memory
Too late I'm engraved in history (I'm here my niggas)
Speak my name and breath life in me
Make sure y'all never forget me (y'all give me life)
Cause y'all use my name so reckless
Whether to be accepted or disrespected (and I love it)
And I love especially when y'all do it in public
And I'm the subject
Cause y'all my niggas

  
Yo I was thinking a little bit what would it take
To authenticate my nigganess
Ball ridiculous
26 inches when I call up the dealership
Yeah that's some nigga shit
We only out for our own benefit
We haven too many kids
We? welfare recipients
The infamous free clinics is the sickest shit
It makes me think what the hell they clean they're syringes with
Everybody bleedin
The cops or the demons
Courtrooms full of goons
Jailbrushers leanin
Handcuffs squeezed too tight
On you?
If u fight they just give in
People used to do sit ins
They got Nigeria and Niger two different countries
Somehow niger turned to nigger
And shit got ugly
The problem is we started thinking like the colonists
To know the [? ]
Started droppin that consciousness



   
My father was not a banker
Neither was my neighbor when it came to getting paper
Who the hell was gonna train us
A pressure couldn't escape us through the ages
We changed the basis of derogatory phrases
And I say it's quite amazing
The use the ghetto terms developed our own language
No matter where it came from
It's celebrated now people are mad if they ain't one

[Chorus: Mykel]
Where there's life there is water
We depend on mama nature
There's a message for tomorrow
Everything connects to you
Some say soon it will be over
You can see it in the weather
Out of tune with mama nature
What you do comes back to you

We're not alone [x4]

    
Confucius, Confucius
Sigmund Freud
And Fard Muhammad
Is it evolution or God?
Searching for the truth is a threat
Seems the closer we get to the truth
State troopers or FEDs come out to silence you
My house in Malibu probably tapped
Because living next door to Demi Moore
Plus, I'm black
Plus, I want vengeance for the poor
Who's attacked daily
Patriot Act never scared me
Jake in the Taurus
Sticky in the jar-s
Niggas I'm with got warrants
America's brown and
Twenty years from now
Every town will be brown and Latin
An African lookin Manhattan
I'm a tell you what I seen with my three eyes
Word to me, not a hoax, back in 9-9
A spacecraft in the skyline
In L.A., in daytime, ask Horse if I'm lying

[Chorus: Mykel]
Every mother, every father
Raise your sons and your daughters
With respect and with honor
From the seed comes a fruit
It's an unbroken circle
All of life is universal
And we're all in the struggle
If I know one thing is true...

We're not alone [x4]

  
Evidence remains in debate
Documents of our own Air Force base
Additional terrestrial information
Other planets with life population
My observation
Scientists study pictures of a flying disc
Right on earth, anthropologists are finding shit
Visitors, probably live with us
They can mimic us
It's sort of what we seeing in the cinemas

    
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we gone survive
Is if we harmonize

We're not alone [x4]

   
Reginald Lewis
The black billionaire
Before Oprah or Bob Johnson
How'd he disappear?
Conspiracy theories, UFO's in the air
I've seen it with my own two eyes
And I swear, like Warren Buffet
Real money I'm just trying to touch it
The diamond-encrusted shit, live illustrious
'Cause we was deprived of it, suffered
Now we pop to prove anything's possible
My pimp strut was invented when they whipped us
Now we diddy-bop just to show you that our strength's up
Just when niggas about to see they cut
Global warming about to burn us up
Niggas never really seen paper in this world
American blacks the teenager of this world
Give us twenty more years to grow up
Already geniuses; what I mean is this
I used to worship a certain Queens police murderer
'Til I read the words of Ivan van Sertima
He inserted something in me
That made me feel worthier
Now I spit revolution
I'm his hood interpreter

    
Take a look in the mirror
And see the bigger picture
It's good to be alive
It's good to be alive
Nobody is an island
We are part of an environment
Only way we gone survive
Is if we harmonize

We're not alone [x4]







They forgot us on the block
Got us in the box
Solitary confinement
How violent are these cops?
They need an early retirement
How many rallies will I watch?
I ain't got it in me to march
I got a semi to spark
The game's in a drought
Public housing, projects
Cooking up in the Pyrex
My set, my click
Either getting money
Or running from homicide trial
That's if they ain't died yet
Trying to be rich
Still I'm pledging allegiance
A predicate felon, a ghetto leader
Lending my poetical genius
To whoever may need it
I bleed this from Queensbridge
Now living with my feet up
Never defeated
So a president's needed
Y'know these colored folks and Negroes
Hate to see one of their own succeeding
America, suprise us
And let a black man guide us

What's the black pres thinkin on election night
Is it how can I protect my life?
Protect my wife? Protect my rights?
Every other president was nottin' less than white
'Cept Thoman Jefferson and mixed indian blood
And calvin coolers
KKK is like 'what the f*ck', loadin' they guns up
I'm loadin' mine too, Ready to ride
Cause I'm ridin with my crew
He dies - we die too
But on a positive side, I think Obama provides
Hope - and challenges minds
Of all races and colours to erase the hate
And try and love one another, so many political snakes
We in need of a break, I'm thinkin' I can trust this brotha
But will he keep it way real?
Every innocent n! gga in jail - gets out on appeal
When he wins - will he really care still?
I feel

Say a prayer for "do we have to? "
You ain't right, Jeremiah Wrong pastor
In love with a slave master
Sincerely yours
USA most brave rapper
Jesse car-jacker
Uncle Tom-kidnapper
Ask around
Bentley Coupe off the richter
B! tch-called-life, I pimped her
What?
Politics, politricks
Klan-shooter
Deacon for defense
Progress-producer
Nothing on the stove
Your survival-booster
Gotta do what we gotta do
We ain't got no governors coming through - to help
Anything we need done, we gotta do for self
New-improved JFK on the way
It ain't the 60's again
Niqqas ain't hippies again
We ain't falling for the same traps
Standing on the balconies
Where they shot the King at
McCain got apologies
Ain't nobody hearing that
People need honesty





Ah yeah, what's happening, Mami
How ya doin' Baby. Oh you lookin kinda good and everything, I see you with those stilhettos baby. Ah, check this out, you ain't got time to talk to me? Ay, let me put this bug in your ear, baby. Won't you turn those flow shoes into your ho shoes, ya dig. yeah check this out. This universe fine as your royal highness. You know what, I can do a whole lotta things for you. Guess Why? Cause I'm a motherf*ckin' pimp.


Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase
In this life, there's pimp's and ho's
Tell me which one are you, you little
Like Me
Hustlin' and gridning baby
I be
Stayin' on that paper chase

The good man in me say get money and stay on the path.

But the pimp shit in me say, yo, keep looking for ass
But my daughter gave me a gift, something to hold
A little city in water, when you shake it, it snow.

I told her never let a sucker nigga take off her clothes

Better wait till you're grown, when they love you, you'll know.

Everybody's got a dream, I hope and wish to own a six times two
Chill in the whip a fantasy a bone to pick to get against who I don't know
To one who said you won't blow
You won't eat, you want cake, they mistake.
Blamin me for they failures I'm fresh.
Getting tailored, single breasted.
A lint brush is senseless, some pimp shit.

A woman hates a man and stay with him for many years. Tell him she loves then be jealous of him. Now lame is how the ghetto judge him. Cause he still with her. She take his cash and give it to some other real nigger.

Like me





This is my openin scripture - I've been preparin this album
My whole life, might be uncomfortable for most you listeners
Satin's bombardin me with propositions, but I decline
I started in the bridge without a pot to piss in
I overcame all the opposition
My teachers told that I'd a broken mayne on a cot in prison
Cloaked in the finest drapes, not bathe in napes
But we still filthy, supreme court say we still guilty
This is the genesis, and I don't even see a worthy arch nemesis
I get loose like the jena six, they put a noose on 'pac
Now I'm defendin vic, and free that nigger tip
I'd take the grave or a bid
To let some dirty clan members run up in my crib
And plant cracks on the man that's goin to church
Plants packs on the man that's goin to work
And build cases, meanwhile they daddies and they brothers
Is recruitin all my brothers and cousins to fill bases
The nerve of y'all to call escobar racist
Nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger, nigger hatred







The Evil genius, Green Latern

[Hook: x2]
The same shit's that going on
The crackheads stalking
Loud mouths is talking
The same shit's that going on
You know I seen it all before

[Nas:]
It's cool enough to win but it's better to hate to lose
There's only one Nas by the hundred thousand use
You lose money chasing women, never lose, women chasing money
Niggaz is broke, plus the wolves is hungry
Morgues full of dead niggaz who is taking money
Morgues full a niggaz who the last shit they ate in their stomach
Spinach and steak
Gortex bootprints still on his face, it's still on his face
When we visit his wake
Whatever's undone I do it
Fight against a whole army one gun I use it
Some suntou shit
Keep it on you like walking ammonia
You far from opponents
We can spar for the moments
I stay in deceitful conversation
With creeps with foul natures
Attempted murder trial the basics
Threatening the witnesses
And relatives of dead victims it's the shit we live
Queens Bridge thug matrimony
Clap a phony
Bullets even hit a crack in his Abercrombie
Psycho analysts was asking me what happened to me
See the yack got to be, then the gat got to me
Then the homies on the block with the stacks of money
Then these beautiful bitches was bending backwards for me
The lames put the rap game in the caskets slowly
Man I don't give a f*ck...

[Hook: x2]
The same shit's that going on
The crackheads stalking
Loud mouths is talking
The same shit's that going on
You know I seen it all before

[Joell Ortiz:]
Planet Earth
The land of the worse
Handle your turf
Cannons a burst and breaks the wrists of amateur jerks
Scare me to hurting on your man and that hearse
I seen it ten times
They get a small article never the headline
Candles in the lobby next to empty yack bottles
Niggaz drunk talking shit like when they see this mac nozzle
But nothing ever happens
Even if it do, nothing ever happens
We don't talk if that ain't gutter you yapping in the ghetto
You can ask a nigga mother what happened and get an echo
When I'm from it's so bad
Bunch of ignorant mulf*ckers with no dads
Oh he did, but he don't care cause he nursing his dope hab
And when him and they mom argue he always throw jabs
So they grip a chrome mag
And walk around like who wanna choke tag
Fiending to leave a head see through like a coke bag
If your life's slightly something like the one that Joe had then you're (Ghetto)
Coup a peas, scoop cheese, duck D's and squeeze
Breezing on hoop tees, bumping new Ortiz
And the houchies please G's by gettin on their knees
Giving a body part the scarecrow knee
I'm living at life
The shit that I write is from my heart, my word
Simple with your pocket grab a sharpy homie mark my words
If anybody interfere with me and these bucks
I ain't only in a career, dawg, I'm beating you up
I'm still ghetto

[Hook: x2]
The same shit's that going on
The crackheads stalking
Loud mouths is talking
The same shit's that going on
You know I seen it all before


  
My niggas got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullies 
Brrat, cars peel, the east coast cartel 
Rats get they tail snapped and trapped 
It's snitches in the streets and it's snitches in rap 
Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya 
Coroner choruses, some from the Bridge to Astoria 
Dreams of fallin' in a elevator passin' floors 
Suddenly s , the doors open up to a brick wall 
I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers 
Picture ya tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up 
Sabotagin' my make-up, my watches get laced up 
Even if they indited Jacob 
Forensics, paramedics, carry cowards off 
The frivolated shock to ya chest, try to cough 
They die and hit Hell from a iron 
I'm fly in YSL, I'm paid from this shit 
Got bitches high as Hell and they f*ckin' like AIDS don't exist 
They get sent to ya hotel or made in this shit 
Put a barrel in the capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out 
You a kid, you don't live what you rap about 
Came poetic, too many haters to count 
Too much paper to count, QB bitch 

[Chorus: x2]
Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn 
Money over bullshit, pistols over brawlin' 
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 
Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength 

   
Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper black carpet 
Thinkin' 'bout which nigga to target 
You kill a nigga today, he lives forever 
So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no martyrs 
Black tech on the table, mag four-four 
Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door 
Black fish eggs nigga, that's the caviar 
You niggas is fish made, y'all niggas is fifth grade niggas 
It's fifty ways to die said the general 
I give you the   five, you will not survive 
Rule 1 cocksucker keep my name from ya tongue 
Rule 2 thought you knew don't f*ck wit' God's Son 
Rule 3, see, matter fact I'll just wait 
If y'all reach   five then I'mma eat y'all alive 
Each one of you guys that claim hip-hop is still alive 
Like y'all ain't in agreement wit' Nas 
I said it's dead muthaf*cka, it's dead bitch 

[Chorus x2]

    
From crack pushers to 'Lac pushers, and ambushers 
And morticians to fortresses, case dismisses 
Laced in riches, cake ridiculous, from nickel and dimin' 
To trickin' them diamonds, Vegas, places in Switzerland 
From nine blast to the auto, have to blast mine 
They blast mine, black nine, you flatline, my cash climb 
Buy rare art, antique pieces, Mona Lisas 
Own, no leases, five star restaurant eaters 
Don't forget who ya peeps is, 'pose to dyin' wit' you 
Sip that good wine wit' you, only if they grind wit' you 
Or slang for ya, seen niggas live, laugh, party and 
Die on that very same corner 
Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable 
Private planes landed out in ???, weed I twirl 
Once even gave me a phobia, that I'll be in the spot 
Trapped like a Madam Zenobias wit' this kid eyein' my Rolly, yo 

[Chorus x2]

There it is... QB bitch.... yeah... QB bitch... 
yeah... yeah... QB bitch...








Yeah yeah yeah yeah y'all... New York City... Tryna to see 
where I'mma go tonight... The most famous town in the 
whole f*ckin' world... The other night, nigga was at Lotus... 
I hit P and them I was Dom P'ed up in there, you know... But I 
found this new spot we went to the other night, yo, check it out 
check it out how it went 

  
It was just cool like, smooth night wit' my jewels bright 
Goons left goons right, coupe wit' blue lights 
Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls 
Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off 
In the loft mixin' hash and 'dro 
Honey spreaded that asshole like a wide mouth bass 
Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast 
When the phone ring, the house lights flash 
Turned down the sound, let's get down to bidness 
Shit about to go down wit' some foul niggas 
What the voice said, "what up pop? Who want it?" 
I put the guap up, get the boy popped 
He say "son s , it's dudes you feedin' 
Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'" 
Dog, why you callin' me? This our food 
You, handle the mouths that it trickles down to 
Niggas want beef, I want some of that cow too 
But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich 
Don't bother me wit' silly shit, call Rico 
He said "it IS Rico, of all people 
Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor 
To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather" 
Said the nigga shot up my cars 
Last night he laid for me to come out my doors? 

     
Niggas always on that bullshit 
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip 
Niggas always on that bullshit 
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit 
Niggas always on that bullshit 
To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip 
Niggas always on that bullshit 
Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit 
You can't kill me 

   
High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass? 
Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half 
You speakin' hogwash, silly shit, ??? to dash 
I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on 
The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don 
What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah 
Packed the nines, yo this nigga's asinine 
Smack ya mom, relaxed and calm, then mack ya mom 
In a casket, you'll get ya fashion on 
You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die 
You'll make maggots turn to flies, f*ckin' wit' Nas 
Remember anyone can get it at anytime 
Lames'll swear by ya name, when they lie 
Get hit wit' the lone star, ripped where ya bones are 
So tell me how yo' ass gon' run, from a C-Z-P-O-1? 
In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser 
Merk you wit'cha own shooters 
All you want is a name, pissed and insane 
My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen 
Then it goin' off, start spittin' 
Niggas try to bring it where I live in 
Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at 
So we waited wit' the cigs blat, blat, blat!










Niggas wanna talk about this rap shit... Niggas wanna talk 
about this money... 'Bout these cars... these homes... these 
labels, clothes, sneakers... Big money shit... Now e'erybody 
tryna get rich... Then get rich nigga f*ck it 

  
Some rap pioneers be them crack heads, when they speak 
You see missin' teeth, silver chain wit' a silver piece 
Niggas ya grandfather age 
They pants still hangin' down they leg talkin' 'bout they ain't paid 
And they hate you 'cause they say you ain't paid dues 
And - was stealin' and robbin' 'em 
I feel it's a problem we gotta resolve 
Hip-Hop been dead, we the reason it died 
Wasn't Sylvia's fault or 'cause MC's skills are loss 
It's 'cause we can't see ourselves as a boss 
Deep rooted through slavery, self hatred 
The Jewish stick toegther, friends in high places 
We on some low level shit 
We don't want niggas to ever win, see everybody got a label 
Everybody's a rapper but few flow fatal 
It's f*cked up it all started from two turntables 

     
When they crown you, and you rise up 
To ya position, carry on tradition 
When they knight you, and you go to fight, go to war 
Don't petition, carry on tradition 
Carry on tradition, carry, c-carry on tradition 
Carry on tradition, when you rep what we rep 
You carry on tradition 

   
Now some of these new rappers got they caps flipped backwards 
Wit' the fingers intertwined in some gang sign madness 
I got an exam to see if y'all pass it 
Let's see who can quote a Daddy Kane line the fastest 
Some of you new rappers I don't understand ya code 
You have ya man shoot you like in that Soprano episode 
Do anything to get in the game, mixtapes 
You spit hate against bosses, hungry f*cks are marvelous 
You should be tossed in a pit full of unfortunate 
Vocalists, niggas I could have wrote ya shit 
I had off time, was bored wit' this, I could have made my double LP 
Just by samplin' different parts of ??? 
Still came five on the charts wit' zero audience 
The lane was open and y'all was droppin' that garbage shit 
Y'all got awards for ya bricks, it got good to ya 
You started tellin' the bigger dogs to call it quits? What?! 

 

    
Now niggas got the studio poppin' it's mad clearer 
Engineers got us ear plugs and still hear us 
The live in the park sound 
Versus the state of the art sound we on the charts now 
From British walkers and Argyles 
Look at us rap stars now, wit' our black cards now 
Fortune 500 listed, brunch at Cipriani's 
Sippin', blunted, wit' rich white guys around me 
Thick white girls around me, Chinese lined up 
'Cause I'm what, every dime lust 
We use to be a ghetto secret, can't make my mind up 
If I want that, or the whole world of people 
Now I carry on tradition 
F*ck a bum wack rapper makin' his career out of dissin' 
Peace to the strugglin' artists and dead ones gone 
We miss 'em, I promise I'mma carry on tradition 





  
Red head kingpin, Tim Dogg? Have you seen 'em? 
Kwame, King T, or King Son 
Superlover C, Cassanova Run 
Antwoinette, Rob Base never showin' up 
You seen Black Sheep, Group Home, Busy B? 
Ask Ill and Al Scratch "Where my Homies?" 
Leave it to y'all, these niggas left for dead 
Last week my man swore he saw Special Ed 
Rap is like a ghost town, real mystic 
Like these folks never existed 
They the reason that rap became addictive 
Play they CD or wax and get lifted 
I recommend when ya kid turn ten 
Let him hear Spice 1, made plenty noise 
Positive K, Father MC, The Skinny Boys 
Where are they now? 

     
Where are they now? 

   
See I remember them forever 
The original Spinderella 
Lakim Shabazz, Nine Double M, Fu-Schnickens 
Buckshot, Finesse and Sequence 
Who was a rappin' duke? Daha 
Silk tie and leather was cute 
Body and soul was Dee from Pump It Up's group 
Oaktown 357, J.J. Fad too 
Had pop hits and gold ropes 
Where my man Young MC and Tone Loc? 
Kris Kross, the B.O.S.S., divine styler 
Def Jef of course let's break it down ta 
Mic Geronimo, Pharcyde and Coolio 
I heard Craig Mack back in the studio 
Have you seen these lost MC's 
Funky Four Plus One, Force M.D.'s 
Miss Melody, I hope she packin' a bankroll 
As well as educated rap for ice and Kangol 
Shante she from around my way yo 
EPMD, K-Solo, where are they now? 

     
Where are they now? 

QB... First off this ain't no diss record, this for some 
of my homies that were misrepresented... Legends of the game... 
You know? What up to Moe Dee the legend... Rest in peace Cowboy... 
Yeah.. all the rappers... Male, female, DJ's, e'erybody... Rest 
in peace Jam Master Jay, the whole crew... word up... Juice Crew 
All-Stars... MC Shan, Tragedy, Craig G... yeah nigga, yeah nigga... 
Shan what up baby? Where are they now?





[Intro: Will.I.Am (Nas)]
Hip hop
Hip hop (Ugh!)
Is dead (Had to flip this track again, y'all!)
Hip-hip hop
Hip hop (Ugh!)
Is dead
Hip-hip hop (Ugh!)
Hip-hip hop...is dead (NYC! Dirty South!)
Hip-hip hop (West Coast!)
Hip hop (Midwest!)
Hip hop (Let's go!)

[Chorus: Nas]
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll put an extended clip and body 'em all day!
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ!
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ!
If hip hop should die before I wake
I'll load an extended clip and body 'em all day!
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ!
Roll to every station, wreck the DJ!

[Will.I.Am:]
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead

    
Yeah, people smoke, chill, party, and die in the same corner
Get cash, live fast, body their man's mama
Quick fast, trigger fingers, on the llama
Revenge in their eyes, Hennessy and the ganja
Word to the wise with villain state of minds
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind
(Grindin', hittin' Brazilian dimes from behind)
Whenever, if ever, I roll up, it's sown up
Any ghetto will tell ya', Nas helped grow us up
My face once graced promotional Sony trucks
Hundred million and billin', I helped blow 'em up
Gave my man my right, I could have went left
So like my girl Foxy, the kid went Def/deaf
So people, who's your   ten?
Is it MC Shan? Is it MC Ren?



[Bridge: Will.I.Am]
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead

    
The bigger the cap, the bigger the peelin'
Come through, something ill, missin' the ceilin'
What influenced my raps? Stick-ups and killings
Kidnappings, project buildings, drug dealings
Criticize that, why is that?
'Cuz Nas rap is compared to legitimized crap
'Cuz we love to talk on nasty chickens
Most intellectuals will only half listen
So you can't blame jazz musicians
Or David Stern with his NBA fashion issues
Oh, I they like me, in my white tee
You can't ice me - we here for life, B!
On my second marriage, hip hop's my first wifey
And for that, we not takin' it lightly
If hip hop should die, we die together
Bodies in the morgue lie together
All together now!



[Bridge: Will.I.Am]
Hip hop just died this mornin'
Hip hop just died this mornin'
Hip hop just died this mornin'
And she's dead, she's dead

[Beats s s]

[Crowd chants "Hip hop!" before and during all of Verse 3]

    
Everybody sound the same, commercialize the game
Reminiscin' when it wasn't all business
It forgot where it started
So we all gather here for the dearly departed
Hip-hopper since a toddler
One homeboy became a man, then a mobster
If it dies, let me get my last swig of Vodka
R.I.P., we'll donate your lungs to a rasta!
[Beats starts up again]
Went from turntables to MP3's
From "Beat Street" to commercials on Mickey D's
From gold cables to Jacobs
From plain facials to Botox and face lifts
I'm lookin' over my shoulder
It's about eighty people from my hood that showed up
And they came to show love
Sold out concert and the doors are closed shut



Look here 'Sheed 
Pretty Mike shanked Two Face Al, over some gal 
Found the body dead in the isles 
Death by strangulation, microphone cord, a dirty broad 
Tell Shaniro play it again Sham, damn, that was my jam 
Now she's on the lam, she made it out wit' two hundred grand 
What a scam! While these two compete on who's the star of the show 
Golden Legs there makes off wit' the dough 
I read the paper there wit' Joe the Butcher 
He says "one glance is all it took ya" she's a real looker 
They say her old man's a bootlegger, transport in any weather 
And at this rate we'll never get her 
Fellas, think it's time I call it a night 
All this talk of mystery dames gettin' me tight 
Thought I saw her in my eyesight, right 
Hate to spoil the party, what are you guys havin'? 
The same? Waiter, another round for the gang 
It's strange how I always felt out of place 
Joe the Butcher's my ace, but in comes Freckleface 
So I said "see ya later" 
Before I hurt him and his two ugly thumb breakers 
He met them in Louisiana wrestlin' gators 
An idiot can tell they're involved in the caper 
So I pulled the revolver out my waist up 
Between a patrol car and a gray truck 
Behind the streetlamp was a silhouette 
White gloves and a real long cigarette 
Whaddaya know? All this time she's got me in the scope 
She spoke, says "the devil got you guys by the choke 
"Your conspiracy theories won't work wit'out evidence 
That's the reason why Eric B. is not President" 

Well whaddaya say? 
Ya see... ya see... ya see... 

Look here 'Sheed, I Know You Got Soul, you tryna hide it 
How'd you kill a man out in Cypress? 
One-Eyed Charlie, he only hangs out wit' the Criminal Minded 
Says you guys did it Doggystyle, is he lyin'? 
She says "Walk This Way I'll tell you a Children's Story" 
We hit the bodega, got her a few forties 
We jumped in my ride, we drove and she cried 
Twisted off the cap there and opened her mouth wide 
Swalllowed It! Whole bottle's half empty 
Drinks like a fish, now she's past tipsy 
The truth came out as we got to her Suave House 
Chopped-N-Screwed her mouth and sat me on the couch 
I said "it's gettin' late c'mon, give it to me straight 
Who's your sponsor, lady?" She says "Bill Gates" 
"What are you born, '77 or '78?" 
She said "nah goes way to an earlier date" 
Slave times, played for slave said rhymes 
But she fell in love wit' some fella named Clive 
Who? Clive Campbell from Cedrick Ave 
The Bronx, now she shows me the cash 
I said "who's Clive, don't play with me skirt" 
She said "Clive Campbell, he's Kool Herc" 

Ah-ha! Ah-ha! 

Listen up sweetheart, now we're gettin' somewhere 
As she's talkin', she starts vanishin' in thin air 
But before she drops the money bag on the floor and died 
She said "if you really love me I'll come back alive"









[Jay-Z: talking]
I know you can feel the magic baby
Turn the muthaf*ckin' lights down
Esco watup?

[Nas: talking]
What up homie

[Jay-Z: talking]
I mean
This is what you expected ain't it?
Let's Go
Uh Uh [repeated]
Turn the music up in the headphones
Yah, that's perfect

You gotta take your time by making a nigga wait on this muthaf*cka
Niggaz is mad and shit like
Niggaz usually start rapping after 4 bars goin in
I could start dancin on this muthaf*cka
Yah

[Nas: talking]
Yah

[Jay-Z:]
I feel like a black republican,money i got comin in
Can't turn my back on the hood, i got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, like f*ck it then

Hovering over the oven, we were like brothers then
Though you were nothing another then the son of ma momma's friend
We had governin', who would have thought the love would end
Like ice cold albums, all good things
Grab a dope, sing the same song that all hoods sing
It was all would bring, all could could bring
We would bicker like the other fools,but talk good game
Never imagine all of the diaster that one could bring
Good friend you should blame the game, I could
Its kill or be killed, my good I reframe
Forever be in debt that's never a good thing
The pressure of success can put a good strain
But a friend you call best, but yes it could bring
Out of the worst in every person, even the good saint
Though we were cursed, the shit ain't tha same
When you cook cane at the age of sixteen
Then you mix things like cars, jewelries, and this thing
Jealously, ego and pride and this brings
All into the head, like a coin, chang ching
The route of all evil strike again, this could sting
Now the team got beat between the post and the point
This puts the ring in jeopardy

I feel like a black republican,money i got comin in
Can't turn my back on the hood, i got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, like f*ck it then

[Nas:]
I feel like black militant, taking over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em
Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, like f*ck it then

I'm back in the hood, everyone's like "Hey Nas"
Blowin on purple, reflecting on they lives
Couple of fat cats, couple of A I's
Dreamin' on fly shit, instead of the great skies
They bring 5's, hate Nas, wishin i bring guys
[?], the niggaz sing "why?"
Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jailtime
Weak minds keep tryin', follow the street signs
Standing on the roof of my building, 
I'm feeling the whirlwind of beef I inhale in, 
just like an acrobat, ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
Sippin on [?], bulletproof undermere
Could be the forces of darkness are against hood angels of good, that forms street politics
Makes a sweet honest kid turn to legal for commerce, to get his feet out of them Converse

I feel like a black republican,money i got comin in
Can't turn my back on the hood, i got love for em
Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, like f*ck it then

I feel like black militant, taking over the government
Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love em
Can't clean up my act up for good, too much thug in em
Prolly in the back of the hood, like f*ck it then

[Nas:] 
What nigga! What bitch-ass niggas! What! Babe, babe, start the car! 

[Kelis:] 
Nasir, come on let's go! Get in the car now, let's go! Throw it out, let's go! 

[Nas:] 
Aight, aight, aight, yeah. But I got 'em. But I got 'em, though. 

[Kelis:] 
This is crazy, why'd you just throw it out of the car? This is so stupid, what are you doing? Why are we even out here? Why are we out here? What's going on? This is retarded, yo we gotta.. This is crazy. Never again. you'd throw everything away, for what? 

[Nas: laughs] 
Yeah my man Kool G Rap told me son do not look back 
Chill up in the mansion with a fat glutious max, relax 
When people act schoolin' with facts, tell 'em 
At this point in my life I'm all about chillin' 
Ridin' around in something sick and the dress flies 
And twist, homie's hermano just died I gotta let it ride 
That's what I got the public thinkin' my nigga 
Just cause I ain't in the hood don't mean shit my nigga 
I know who died before the body dropped 
I know the guns that were used how much money the shooter got 
Cause on the private yacht I'm still within earshot of it all 
The   ten list of the most grimiest guys of all time 
Is all we talk when we talk of New York y'all 
Who to call and who to stay away from 
Whose mother's address to have just to play it safe son 
Women they lust up so quick to give 'em up 
What cars and what trucks they drive in what towns 
They spend the most time in when they grindin' 
I found out most of them are cowards they hidin' 
Behind reputations that's sour 
Not going back 

[Kelis:] 
The streets keep tryin' to say 
Come back around this way 
I've already gone that way 
I won't go back today 

[Nas:] I'm not goin' back 

[Kelis:] 
The streets keep tryin' to say 
Come back around this way 
I've already gone that way 
I won't go back today 

[Nas:] I'm not goin' back 

[Nas:] 
First thing that happen when you make a little paper 
You think the Marriot is livin' in a skyscraper 
Till you come across some ever more flyer paper 
Realize that five-star 'tellies are even greater 
Terry-cloth robes, elegance, movie shit 
Heated-up marble floors with jacuzzis in it 
First-class flights, diamonds in your crucifixes 
All those things you still ain't really doin' shit kid 
Cause in reality I'll learn my salary 
The way I flaunted it then would now embarrass me 
It kinda make me wanna hate bling it's a race thing 
How they sell blacks to bootleg shit infact 
Real millionaires spend 60 mil on paintings 
Whores charge niggas with raping 
Cause we come out doors of Maybach cars 
Watch us make bets on race tracks smokin' cigars 
So they counter the laws to take what's ours 
Bout 500K on a lawyer to beat the charge 
So you can't s  us from making a billion dollars 
Instead of goin' back I'm buying the projects 
But I'm not going back the hood's in me forever y'all 
But I'm not going back 

[Kelis:] 
The streets keep tryin' to say 
Come back around this way 
I've already gone that way 
I won't go back today 

[Nas:] I'm not goin' back 

[Kelis:] 
The streets keep tryin' to say 
Come back around this way 
I've already gone that way 
I won't go back today 

[Nas:] I'm not goin' back 

[Nas:] 
And of course y'all know what I'm not going back to 
Those no friends and I'm not going back to 
Ten carat gold no I'm never going back to 
Sony if they don't have dough to going back to 
Y'all know that I'm not going back to 
Those liars who would.. 
(Not going back to) 
Not help you if they could.. 
(Not going back to) 
Coke on the stove in the hood.. 
Y'all should know that I'm not going back 
The hood's in me forever y'all 
But I'm not going back 

[Kelis:] 
The streets keep tryin' to say 
Come back around this way 
I've already gone that way 
I won't go back today 

[Nas:] I'm not goin' back 

[Kelis:] 
The streets keep tryin' to say 
Come back around this way 
I've already gone that way 
I won't go back today 

[Nas:] I'm not goin' back







[Sample + (Kanye West):] 
Some people (Yeah) 
Some people (unh-unh) 
Some people really are 
Still dreaming (And as the sun sets 
and the night falls) 
They are still dreaming (and them hoes call) 

[Verse 1: Kane West] 
He pulled up at 6:30 in his 745 
As he wavin' his shorty hi, you know he showin' his bling out 
She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out 
His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out 
How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out 
Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out 
When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout? 
If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out 
Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out 
Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out 
You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna min-gle 
Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now 
Nightmares from ya dream gal make ya scream out 

[Chorus: sample + Kanye & Nas] 
Some people really (still dreamin') 
Some people really (make ya scream out) 
Some people really are (still) 
Still dreaming (st-still dreamin') 
(O-o-o-o-one two one two 
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) 
They are still dreaming 
(O-o-o-o-one two one two 
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) 

Some people really 
Some people really 
Some people really are 

     
How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich? 
Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick 
So if he feed ya family and he serve you shit 
Then he need that head you get and he deserve ya bitch 
Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life 
Dwellin' on the past when you was alright 
When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright 
Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells 
Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self 
Want niggas to show you, how to come up wit' green 
I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the f*ck was your dream? 
Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen 
Wit' little niggas wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing 
How high was I? You the thousandth guy 
That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye 
We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together 
Now you gets deaded on 

[Chorus: sample + Kanye & Nas] 
Some people really (so keep dreamin') 
Some people really 
Some people really are (still dreamin') 
Still dreaming 
(O-o-o-o-one two one two 
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin') 
They are still dreaming 
(O-o-o-o-one two one two 
Some dreams stay dreams some dreams come true) (still dreamin') 

Some people really 
Some people really 
Some people really are 

     
She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle 
Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure 
Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who 
Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools 
And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news 
But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school 
Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews 
She worked for Fox News 
One of her mans that she lent her drop to 
Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it 
Says it's important that it looks like an accident 
She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it 
Sheets was recordin had a wire, askin' shit 
Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks 
Crossed the line from her world of news castin' 
To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone backwards 
Still dreamin' 

[Chorus: sample + Kanye & Nas] 

[Sample of "They are still dreaming" to end]




[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

    
Yea, Feds feast on street dons, look at their teeth showin'
Salivatin' at the mouth, South to East Orange
Keep pourin' that liquor, but nigga don't sleep on it
You'll be givin' up your Jesus piece to your peeps to pawn it
For legal fees in the penal dorm
Screamin' on the horn with 'bout thirty years on your conscience
I'm watchin' brothers disappear, it's appallin'
Some dudes had just only a year of ballin'
Counter-intelligence found a strange evidence (When the block is hot)
Still we behind the wheel with heat on us, hangin' with predicates
Position we placed in caves in, so they got us caged in
Ways spinnin' like Mike Bivens from New Edition aging (I gotta... When the
block is hot)
I got families I'm feeding 'cause my mans is bleeding
Every five seconds look in all directions
I come through prepared; I give 'em a call
I'm close, bring them guns downstairs

[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot (hold it down)
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

    
Uh, uh, it's beef week, Monday, murder
Two niggaz dead, Tuesday
Wednesday and Thursday is hearse-day
Friday, somebody-gotta-die-day
Saturday, put the gat away
Chillin' wit your chick and a bag of haze
Wonderin' how it's all gon' end and what type of way
'Cause Sunday back to gunplay
Mo' shit start over nothin'
And get finished quick 'cause the art of repercussion
Yeah, I seen it, a G' going out indecent (When the block is hot)
Takin' a plea agreement, thinkin' he secret
Escape the crime scene, now you live straight like 9:15
Then one-time intervene (I gotta lay...)
My man ain't like me sayin' I don't care if I die
But the SIG Sauer on me now I'm scared to die
You thinkin' the one I send to clap you be a shorty
But he old school, holdin' a .38, he in his forties

[Chorus: Mark B. Mayfield]
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation

    
(I gotta...) Anytime brothers can't get jobs, then they rob
(When the block is hot) A man rather die than live on his knees and starve
Cops steady askin' your man what happened
First he tell then he s , like he not really rattin'
Guess he not really in that casket from a sawed-off (When the block is hot)
Listen, peep game from the brain of an all-star
The rain hurt niggaz bones who been shot
Metal pins in their leg, they walk with a limp-hop
The streets lie, (When the block is hot) so you better be cautious
Your man'll fry you plus, everybody talkin'
A vet, a General, don't step where I walked in
Make your own path, be a legend in your skin
(Hold down the block, when the block is hot)
Make your own cash, don't stress what I'm forcin'
Don't expect more when you put in less work than all them
Queensbridge projects has taught him, and that's for life
You heard me right, I got the block (When the block is hot)

[Outro: Mark B. Mayfield]
When the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation
I gotta hold down the block, when the block is hot
I gotta use my imagination, to change the situation







Yo I wonder if Langston Hughes and Alex Hailey got blazed before they told stories, 
Well I'm gonna get blazed before I tell y'all stories, 
I saw on TV today this man lost his son, his son died, 
So he had him cremated, took his ashes, and made it into a diamond ring 
Now he watch his son shine everyday, 
I just thought about that, while I sit here ashin in this ash tray 

 
The makin' of a mad man who entered stories of Devante Swing, 
Eva Gardner, the crashin of James Dean, 
Bobby Brown, influenced by Rick James it goes, 
Prince wanted Alexander O' Neill to be Morris Day or Jerome, 
But Alex was puttin' coke in his nose nigga while it, 
Could be a myth but I swear that the source was close, Phyllis Hyman, 
Killed himself it was crazy, mommy was bad, they say, 
Donny Hathaway freefall from a balcony, he sways 

    
As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me, 
Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me, 
The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me, 
I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me. 

  
Sam trusted Womack with his main lady, he tossin' in the grave like 'this is how you repay me,' 
A change goin' come, wish you didn't trust me so much, 
Marvin said 'No mountains high enough,' fly stuff, 
David Ruffin was punchin' Tammy Tyrell, gave her concussions, 
While, the Funk Brothers was layin' down the percussions, 
When Flow from the Supremes died, Diana Ross cried, 
Many people said that she was laughing inside (Why?). 

    
As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me, 
Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me, 
The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me, 
I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me. 

   
John F. Kennedy's enemies dealt with treachery, it interests me, 
Julie Campbell in Gucci sandals, she's what a temptress be, 
The death of Anis Cosby, what a mystery, 
All of Chicago and Herald Washington, someone is sabotagin' him, 
Watch out for the traps, Larry Troutman killed his brother, Roger Troutman, then he killed himself, that's the end of zat, 
And I wouldn't change a thing, mistakes of the greats, 
This is what came from they pain, from they hurt we gain, an unfair exchange. 

    
As a blunt ash falls into the ashtray, I can see my whole life fly past me, 
Did I (Did I) keep it gangsta or keep it classy, and will the money and fame outlast me, 
The blunt's ash fall down in the ash tray, will I see my whole life fly past me, 
I'm askin did I keep it gangsta or keep it classy, (did I) anything else you wanna know, just ask me 

I can smell old bogie's cigars, 
Knall Recam's perfumes smellin just as sweet, 
Me and my wife K flyin in the drop-  like Ruby and OZ Davis baby, know what I mean, 
Yo man, get smoked out, start thinking about Hadie McDaniels, 
Got an Oscar for playing Mamie in "Gone With the Wind," 
And she didn't even get allowed, wasn't allowed to go to the premier, 
You believe that, couldn't go to premier, to her joint, 
Man, you know they were strong back then yeah, 
Blunts, fallin, ashtray




 
...Let there be light
No gangbanging in New York tonight
Just murals of Biggie Smalls bigger than life
Turn up the kid mic because ya'll anit listening right
What's all this talk that Nas got hawked?
I'd rather outline my body in white chalk
Anit nobody been where I been they at standstill
This is all overseen by man Will


As I walk through the valley of shadow of death
I know that I ain't got much time left
And they don't really wanna see the good in me
Ain't satisfied until they see the fool in me
And all my business all my sin is straight ??
and thank the hood for all the love they gave
Forgive em all for all in this to hate
ohhh let their be light

  
This anit to glorify just painting a street picture
There's no goddess or bibles just blunts and swishers
Gillette's cut caine in the kitchen
Now every rapper wanna claim he hang with Kenneth "Supreme" Griffin
It's like the same difference except when nigga's get arraigned
They don't want the same sentence, nigga's get to snitching
If I could reverse the minds and turn falls to rises and bring back nigga's who was livest
Old hustlers reminiscing on better days they home
Doing nothing might as well be in a cage
Hating on young brothers one foot in the grave
They used to love us 'til we found our own way through the maze
New York set trippin and flagging, got the west coast laughing
Now Esco's asking, what happened ?
My home girl from Upper Manhattan she remembers the quarters thats latin
A lot of rat-a-tat-tatting



   
The son of the audio cassette era, tech wearer
Bullets and burgettes Benz Bo speak a terror
Demand I get mine till I'm dead so I can drop something red
Like that horse standing on its hind legs
Since Arnold and Willis in there bunk beds
I went and bread like wonder
Not Ned the wineo like the parents of Lionel
Nas is the ghetto American idol
No matter what you do your never getting my title
I can't sound smart because you'll run away
They say I ain't hungry no more and I don't talk about yay
Like there's no other way for an ex hustler, cake getter,
Ex rich splitter to touch ya
I beg to differ
When your fours years in the game we can have a conversation
Eight years in the game I invite you on vacation
Ten years in the game
After I've enjoyed my fame,
only then I'll let you pick my brain
Niggas

Right about now,
I don't have to deal with all that garbage
We getting real right you know
This isTre Williams, Ladies & Gentlemen
Focus on good things man, good times
Heh heh, alright

[Hook x2]

Ooo, let it be, let it be [fades]




     
Uh, light somethin', s  frontin' 
how much money's enough, think maybe like a trillion' figures 
pray my daughter don't wild like them Hilton sisters, that'd kill me yo, filthy rich, my daughter pass it on to the next generation, throwin' carnations at my tombstone, in my new home, meet mom's in my Yves Saint Laurent suit on, then we do a dance like my man luther dan, but my verse came first, i stole change out her purse, now i wanna dig her up outta the earth, two more but lean forward, toward a new paragraph, blue carrots, D-class, strictly that cush in the weed bags, tryna' figure out what Barry Gordy (?) had, put in production, studio's smokey now, hard like Davin Ruffin, hit a spliff through a seance, and uh, play on playa 

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]

Ruby red grapefruit juice with grey goose, rubies in the Jesus piece, pimped out like Snoopy, but a East Coast thing, my girl's stocking, tied up in a knot   a' my beanhead, billion dollar dream here, went from triple beams to digitals, servin' fiends to minimal, sixty g's no criminal, no mo', jus mo' doe, my motions pouring, Oprah's earrings, on fingers while your girl performs cunninglingus, cause' there's big money a rumour lingers, barber cleans his blade, then they give me a fade, hot towel on the face, hot models who vommit after they eat so they can stay lightweight, swallowin' my protien like an Ovaltine shake, come thru like Moe Greene from Godfather, so clean where i step i 'Clorox it', keep twenty g's on both sides of the thigs, that's four pockets, eighty thousand, browse for the nicest price, but we ain't into buyin' conflict ice, that's the shit they stole from the Congo, another block soil, true mack foil, nappy here jus spinnin', hunny gave me a massage with the happy ending, finest females i jus came on, and sprayed uh, gotta get yeh papes on, play on playa 

[chorus: Snoop Dogg]

play on, play on, [quiets] play on, play on, play on



[Nas:]
There comes a day in ya life
When ya wanna kick back
Straw hat on the porch
When you old perhaps
Wanna gather your thoughts
Have a cold one, brag
To your grandkids on how life is golden
So I'ma light a cigar in the corridor of the crib
Pictures on the wall of all the things that I did
All the money and fame, 8x10's of the whole Rat Pack inside of a big frame
Colliding with big names that coulda made your career s 
All that, and your man is still here, and I'm still hot
Wow! I need a moment y'all, see I almost felt a tear drop...

[Bridge:]
When was the last time you heard a real anthem?
Nas, the millionaire, the mansion
When was the last time you heard your boy Nas rhyme?
Never on schedule, but always on time

[Chorus: Chrisette Michelle]
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a thing's gonna break me)
These streets hold my deepest days
This hood taught me golden ways
Made me (truly this is what made me)
Break me (not a thing's gonna break me)
Ooooh I'm that history, I'm that block
I'm that lifestyle, I'm that spot
I'm that kid by the numbers spot
That's my past that made me hot!
Here's my lifelong anthem: Can't forget about you!! [Nat King Cole sample in background as Chrisette ad-libs]

    
Can't forget about the old school
Bam, Caz, Mele Mel, Flash
Rock Steady spinning on their back
Can't forget when the first rap Grammy went to Jazzy
Fresh Prince - Fat Boys broke up, rap hasn't been the same since
So irregular, how it mess you up when Mr. T became a wrestler
Can't forget about Jordan's retirement
The shot Robert Horry hit to win the game in the finals, kid
Some things are forever, some things are not
It's the things we remember that gave the world shock
They stay in a place in your mind so snug
Like who the person was with whom you first made love

[Bridge]



    
Unforgettable, unsubmittable
I go by "N" now, just one syllable
It's the end 'cause the game's tired
It's the same vibe Good Times had right after James died
That's why the gangsta rhymers ain't inspired
Heinous crimes help record sales more than creative lines (creative liiiines)
And I don't wanna keep bringing up the greater times
But I'm a dreamer, nostalgic with the state of mind
The past the past, enough of it, aight then
But nothing gives me chills like Douglas and Tyson (Tyson)
Or Mike when his talk was live
Or when he first did the moonwalk on Motown 25

[Bridge]

[Instrumental slows as chorus is sung...blends into Nat King Cole - Unforgettable sample]

That's why darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am...unforgettable too.


[Nas:]
Dre, he a Compton-Compton O.G.
Nas, he a QB-QB true G
Do the history

Way before The Firm, like back in the day
Nas was the first New York nigga rappin' with Dre
So of course I got a track to bring it back to your face
The one kid that would've been Aftermath that got away
But we still get together like every several years
to sprinkle, a little bit of Heaven for your ears
Relax sippin' Calico in Rio, stupid f*ckers
Low-key, know G's, but it's still Gucci luggage
I love Cape Cod, and watchin' fly bitches with grey eyes
wrestle in a tub of KY to get my day by
I like to celebrate, why? - 'cause I can vision
collages and images of my lies with no regret to hate
So every breath I take, is all about the rules
It's hard for you to breathe like you at high altitude
So crack the Patrón, it's on heathens, The God's back
Hard body, Mr. Jones never leavin'

[Chorus 1:]
Hustlers, dealers, drop-  riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast we riders

[Chorus #2: Nas (The Game)]
He a Compton-Compton O.G.
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots

[The Game:]
1995, eleven years from the day
I'm in the record shop with choices to make
"Illmatic" on the   shelf, "The Chronic" on the left homie
Wanna cop both but only got a twenty on me
So f*ck it, I stole both, spent the twenty on a dub sack
Ripped the package off "Illmatic" and bumped that
For my niggaz it was too complex when Nas rhymed
I was the only Compton nigga with a "New York State of Mind"
Inside the dope house bottlin' up sherm, bangin' The Firm
Dre was king then so I waited my turn
Fast forward, now I'm makin 'em burn
Ended my peers careers, hollered at Nas, a hard lesson was learned
So I reconciled my differences like he did with Jigga
I s ped beefin' with niggaz, 'cause I'm "Ether" to niggaz
Comb the earth 'til there's no one left
"If I Ruled the World" I summons all you weak rap niggaz to death

[Chorus: Nas (The Game)]
He a Compton-Compton O.G.
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots

[Nas:]
Yo, the Jordans sportin'
Come off the dice game with a fortune walkin', you a walkin' coffin'
The musket I tucked it, you bluff it I bust it
You're sideways talkin', so I lay often
I wait patient, to duct tape hatin'
F*ck ass niggaz, get bucked ass niggaz
Pluck ashes - of Cuban cigars, you foolin' with Nas
That's my name and I came with Rugers this time
And if I'm sane that "Soul Plane" movie's the bomb
Word to my mom's name tattooed to my arm
You can't revolve me, embalm me, calm me or harm me
Rob me or dodge these bullets I'm bustin'
See that's malarky you yappin'
I open up the tripod to put the gatling on, and I start clappin'
Nasty man, from baggin' grams and runnin' from cops
to a mill' on the hand, a mill' on the watch, I'm f*ckin' with Doc

[Chorus 1:]
Hustlers, dealers, drop-  riders
Make that cake, cop two five fivers
Pimps and players, platinum diamonds
East to West Coast we ridin'

[Chorus 2: Nas (The Game)]
He a Compton-Compton O.G.
(Mix that with a QB-QB true G)
(What you got's) A concoction of some different ghetto blocks
(West Coast kill the tracks) East Coast gunshots








[Intro: Chrisette Michele]
Hip-Hop -    it will never die
Hip-Hop - Hip-Hop will never, never die

    
Ghetto niggaz struttin' with nothin' but dreams and Queens broke
Mack-10's, you can smell the PCP smoke
Mele Mel told it real in the music he wrote
Those were the days I remember
We used to be close, then I was nine, coldest winter I remember
Was slippin' in December, two feet of snow
Yeah, that's the East Coast, that black ice
Symbolized the rap life
It was slick and smooth
I understood I had to come from the hood
Doin' the Pee Wee Herman, the Smurf
Before them phones chirped
The block's drugs flowin', didn't have your own work
You had to have somebody else's, a small chrome on your pelvis
Starter Jacket, Blue Georgetown or Green Celtic
Your girl's too expensive, she wants shellfish
Red Lobster was poppin', standin' on that line forever
I wish somebody would step on my Bally leather's
Now it's whatever... hip-hop's forever
Kept my radio on 98 or BLS
Had a pre-pubescent lyric gift but niggaz never hear me spit
My little brother tried to warn 'em, I was a tornado comin'
He knew from inside, like the eye of a storm
And told my pops about it
He gave us tickets to that Wild Style flick
Double Trouble, retarded, we was the proudest
I never had a summer job
Sweepin' leaves, socks to my knees
Homemade shorts cutoff, Lee's
I ain't work a day in my life
Wipin' away eraser of the paper man
I'm just tryin' to say it right
Big radio, tape slowin' down
Lower the lights go, battery dead
I gotta freeze 'em 'til they ice cold
In the freezer later, I'm starin' at the speaker
Sunk in them 808's deeper, cleanin' my sneakers
Wit the bristles of a toothbrush, soap and water
I let the shoe strings soak in water...

[Chorus is sung over Nas outro]

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Live hip-hop live, live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays

[Outro: Nas]
Ain't got nothin' to do wit old school, new school
Dirty South, West Coast, East Coast
This about us, this our thing, 'knaw'sayin'?
This came from the gut, from the blood, from the soul
Right here man, this is our thing man
You know, so I say what I say
And I say what I say, and I mean it
Y'all take it how you wanna take it
Cause if you're askin' - Why is hip-hop dead?
It's a pretty good chance you're the reason it died, man
It's a pretty good chance your lame ass, corny ass, is the reason it died, man
You don't give a f*ck about, you don't know nothin' about it
You want this paper, be a hustler
You a hustler, you ain't a rapper
Get your paper man
YouknowwhatI'msayin, but this rap shit is real
Bitch, this shit is real, bitch, ha-ha

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, (Live) stay hip-hop stay (Live)
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays

Live hip-hop live, (Stay) live hip-hop live
Give hip-hop give, give hip-hop give
Stay hip-hop stay, stay hip-hop stay
I pray, hip-hop pray, I pray hip-hop stays








[Intro: Nas]
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em [x7]
Yeah

    
They dug me out the soil in the Mines of the Motherland
Now I'm misplaced, one hand to another hand
Illegal smugglin', people strugglin'
Wish they could just throw me back in the mud again
Yeah, guess that's how we got here
Slave Trade then the Diamond Trade
Every child's afraid
When his Mother and Father get sprayed
Forced in the Army, young killer Brigade
Gets a new name and then he give his nose glue
Til' his mind can't take what he's gon' through
Lookin' in that dirt for that ice so blue
Then The Royal Family, the ice goes to
And this thing has to change, feelin' half-ashamed
As I rap with my Platinum chain
When you shop for a gift for me
You think about the misery?
The same way we made Apartheid History
We can do the same thing to the conflict ice
But everybody wanna shine, right?

[HooK: Nas]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna Shine on 'em
Shine on 'em [x7]

    
My VVS glimmers on my chest
200-thou-encrusted watch on my wrist
I wonder how people starve to death
When God bless the land that lacks the harvest
The stone's equality, but they homes are poverty
And the whole world ignores the robbery
Bought my girl pretty rocks when she's mad at me
Tear-drop shaped, uh, perfect Clarity
It shocks, so many are killed annually
'Cause of greed, lust, and pure Vanity
S  talkin' and do somethin' about it
Every Holiday Season, Jewelry stores crowded
Kids snatched from their homes, Mutilated alive
Husbands separated from wives, keep a Jesus piece to be fly
But back in the day there was a time when they called us shine

[HooK: Nas]
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
Everybody wants Heaven but nobody wants dead
Everybody wants Diamonds without the Bloodshed
They wanna shine on 'em
Shine on 'em [x7]

[Man Singing & Humming in Foreign Language]

    
It's the late night greasy spoon patron
Poolhall making
Big bets, midsection got the 8 in
Dior Christian pimpin'
Got that penal system diction
Riffing, you don't want it you snitchin'
Spit a few at a traitor with that new AR
Try to kill me I'm the leader, that's coup d'etat
Streetsweepers in that Coupé all black
Bitches want my chipped tooth back
Steel mac, so my kufi never gets smacked
Squeeze a fifth with a grip as I dip
From the paparazzi
Still playing numbers you can't s  me
Still wearing bundles, and spark weed
If I ever say "Queens get 'em", you know they got me
Success, scandal, bone deep, personal beef
So lead by example, or get trampled
Since Hip Hop Is Dead, this is the N
Congratulations in order 'cause we did it again

[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted 'cause you know that I love the dro

    
The style is taboo, the chain's offensive
Brain on airplanes, Gucci frames are vintage
The two Tec Don in Yukon's and Benzes
Chicks who suck other chicks tits like infants (wow)
The Apprentice but not Trump
I'm the nigga with glocks and pumps
That you don't see much
Sucker free from chumps
Homes with cobblestones in front of 'em
He's got guns in cummerbunds, so understand you under son
Don't make me have you running from a hundred guns
Don't make me grab your only son
I'm coming from
A place Tanqueray and weed's the only escape
From phonies who hate
When you rolling with papes
That's why the god party with juicy models
They mob me, Denali, Charlie Luciano - hardly
Have to tell y'all, I kill y'all
For spitting songs that involve me nigga
Original verbal assassin, have to carve me a nigga

[Hook: Nas]
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still getting it and don't even love the doe
Don't hate me now, congratulate me now
I'm still ripping, and I don't even love the hoes
Still getting it and don't even love the doe
Steel gripping it, you know that I tug the fo'
Stay splifted 'cause you know that I love the dro





    
Where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?
Where where them gangsters at?
Where them dimes at?

Where them gangsters at?

Where where them dimes at?

[Nas:]
I slow dance with the Devil
Snow setting in the bezzle
Mo' sipping, phantom bumping Aaron Neville
Polo black scented, eyes squinted
Air Force One's, with my own patent in it
Fresher than a star, glowing up in the galaxy
Pagan holidays, are way far from my reality
Far through Evisu jeans, lethal green
Oliver peoples shades when I creep through Queens
With no AKs, I'm the ambassador
Robin Hood in the Aston Mart.
Lotta blood gonna splash in war
Task force homicide, federalies gonna arrest
But y'all ain't never seen nothing
Not a word not a hint, on the kid from the Project Bench
That went Sony-BMG, to that new conglomerate
Island Def Jam, guess how many dollars was spent
To get the best man, yall niggaz ain't silencing shit
Ya bench been wanna police the dick
The big Benz, Imma model ya chick
Was that posing, cash froze her
Cats stroke her, once I smash it's over
Cold like ice, more chains than slaves
Dangerous ways, Poltergeist change the channel
Roll the dice, I bring change when I gamble
I could sell sand to a Arab, hot and my gun handle



[Nas:]
The ill whip pusher, my spit wet ya
If you stand close to the woofer
Betcha get sprayed by my lecture
Any club with ladies or dimes, I'm a regular
Give it up smooth, I ain't beggin ya
Intelligent brainiac, brains maniac
Back of the Maybach, taste that, don't waste that
Eat with my elbows   of the table
Street etiquette with speech impediments
And s'til see presidents, no matter who paid
Cause you ain't take the last dollar made
Long as they keep printing it, there's chances of getting it
Money's my bitch, and we stay intimate
Ask about Nashwan, could ask about Jung
Ask about Bravehearts, and ask where I'm from
Q Boro, specifically The Bridge
Don't ask no more question, ya know what it is



[Nas:]
Whether chrome sparking or loan sharking
Busting rachets or numbers rackets or drug traffic
My funds are wrapped up, no concerns who has what
Financer, skull doo wrapped up
Mob life, prizefights, plasma tvs or first floor
Diversified all my circle
Amid the most sickest groom the proof swiftness
Numero uno, annuit to wet this
That's the language of our Latin ancestors
On the back of a dollar, the plan and the message
In the Rolls Royce like the King of Nigeria
My criteria, smoke cigars
Change rap like Jimi Hendrix changed Rock And Roll
With a broke guitar, diamonds flashing
Almost put a million cash in, in my mommy casket
Seen more green than St. Patrick-trick



















 
Peace, how you?
I aint mean to be late, it was my night to watch my little girl.
It's chilly out here.
What happened, you cryin?
Ya'll got into it again, huh?
See you gotta let em know, from the jump, I don't care who they are, or who they with. 
Yeah, I know they know we talking. 
Why don't they just leave us alone?
I know it's hard for them to understand people like us can love each other.
Come on, s  cryin' now.
Oh, there's somethin I gotta tell you, I heard they watchin you, yeah they watching you.
They watchin me too.
But there aint no reason to get low, I'm proud, I'm here.
You know, Imma stand up for you, no matter what; and I konw you'll stand up for me. 
I don't have no doub about you bein true to me.
The world is ours, but right now i feel like the whole world is against us.
So study, be strong, don't cry no more.
(cont. on A Message To The Feds, Sincerely, We The People)

    
I walk the block like whatever god, my message to y'all feds
Who desperate to arrest us young, benevolent hardheads
Abrochrombie & Finch rockin', wrist glistenin' marksman
Hitchcock of Hip-Hop since Big Pop departed
The project logic is still salute the dead, glocks spit
Pour some juice out for those in Manchester, Viewmount
Otisville, Newasberg, Fort Dicks, Fort Worth, Oakdale
Every fed jail where all my dawgs lurk
War hurts much to gain 'til the day we all say
May your pain be champagne then we all blaze away
At our enemies, may they die easily
Long as they perish forever's what freedom means to me
Blowin' greenery, growing eager to see evil things
Thrown away, zonin' grey, GT, Diesel jeans
Airs and Chucks, solitaires, stones with the rarest cuts
On some Pretty Tone shit, haircut looks airbrushed
And they're aware of us though
And we don't give a flyin' 7-47 f*ck though
Stayin' on my hus-tle
[beat change]

    
A message to those who trapped us up, from federal guys who backed them up
We never will die, we black and tough, lead in your eye, we strapped to bust
Half of us been locked up inside the beast, look at the time we see
Brooklyn to Compton streets, Queens, even the Congo needs dreams
Our bullets and triggers our enemies pullin' on innocent women and children
It wasn't no ghetto killers who mixed up the coke and put guns in our buildings
But I'm not gon' cry, and I'm not gon' stand just watch you die
I'ma pass you a .9, I'ma grab your hand -- come on let's ride
A message to those who killed the king, who murdered the Christ
The same regime, what God has built you never can break
What God has loved you never can hate, man makes rules and laws
You just a ruthless dog, your kennel is waiting
You devils will run back into the caves you came from
Whenever that day comes, forty-acres, plantations, see every race won
Sincerely yours, Street's Disciple, revelations






    
I had bad chicks that blow cum bubbles like bubblegum
Plus they ass lick, summer house be sippin' rum
Layin' lazy in the recliner, couple days
In my ashtray, smoke signals from the haze
I stick my finger through it, the ring of smoke broke
That symbolize weak guys, pop the strong link off
The infrastructure caves in, amazin'
I ain't have to read The Art of War to slay men
Serve niggaz, bird niggaz speakin' reckless
When their momma love the kid's records I made
You gutless, you don't know struggle
Throw a couple slugs at you, hell grabs you
Nail stabs a hand of the Nasirine
I carried the cross to help you afford that plasma screen
Gave you chumps a path to walk, hold my hand
I'ma guide you like the OG, but don't talk, don't get it confused
'Cause none'a y'all can fit in my shoes
Y'all made of chemicals, artificial actions
God'll forgive you bastards
Only if you repent to the Nazareth Savage

    
I squeeze nipples like pimples to get the puss, get it?
Form a crew, swallow forty cal' bullets after dinner's finished
Wash it down with a shot of tequila, pocket full'a scrilla
Can't come close to, Francis Copala, Samson -- no Delilah
You're pint-sized, I'm mic's eyes with the gladiator tattoos on it
You scared to look too long at, sit on a don's lap
Tell you a story shorty, spicy like lories
Chickenheads and orgies, criminals that draw heat in their late forties
Drug habits, love grabbin' kids up like yours
Sendin' you a picture of them in their drawers with black eyes
Savage guys, you hire Magnum PI's to bag up my guys
Said you was a thug with a good disguise, try to protect your cabbage
You're runnin' from the Nazareth Savage

    
Son's backward flows, they say mine is very scary
Smell fear like a canine that finds buried babies
And all of y'all wear that same aroma
How to blow on your eighth LP, I'll show ya
You're wack nigga, face it
In the history of the game, you have no placement
Liquor and weed just massacred their mind, or thee celebrity
Or they couldn't change with time, so now they run they mouth
But when the sun go south, them comes come out
My cavalry woulda been threw ten in your skin
Casualty you don't wanna be, don't want it with me
Straight savage

[Sample - Nas: "Political"]

[Newscaster:] "Recently there has been an emergence of socially
conscious and political rappers.    It seems to be
a new trend in the Hip-Hop world."

[DJ scratches sample - Nas: "Nas is a rebel to America" 3X]

[Vers 1: Nas]
Yeah, check it, uh
Spot build-rocker, lil' papa killed Hoffa
Beard lil' longer, feel strong and I'll s  ya
Drill sergeant, still thorough, wheelbarrows of distilled vodka
Get me real bonkers like Will Ferrell on cat tranquilizer
Rap guys get bank and think they messiahs, but they liars
Vote fo who now? You're red, white and blue?
I'm American too, but I ain't with the president's crew
What you peddlin' and who you peddlin' to?
You ain't got the ghetto with you
Try'na lead my sheep to the slaughterhouse
Talkin 'bout +Rap the Vote+, you ain't thought about
The black vote mean nathan, who you gonna elect
Satan or Satan? In the hood nothin is changin, uh
We ain't got no choices who to choose
Ten-years ago they were tryin to s  our voices
And end Hip-Hop, they some hypocrites
Condoleeza Rice - I don't really get this chick
Tell her if she ever really cared about poor schools
About poor children, then she gotta prove that she
ain't just another coon Uncle Tom fool
Like these MC's, gotta give 'em the rules
Lie to the youth, Uncle Tom you confused
Might as well give the Hip-Hop community a noose
Need a truce with the gangs and some food for the hungry
On Kerry nuts, he look at you like a monkey
You MC's on that old slavery path
The Bushs'll look at yo' ass and laugh
See, it's all about community, let's help ourselves
Cops brutalize us get dealt with with shells
It's our turn, it's 'bout time we win
Need somebody as the hood as my councilman, uh

[Chorus: Kelis]
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
([Nas:] Cause that's the American way)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way

    
Up in the steam room chillin', exfoliating the skin
It's rarely men conversatin' on ends, probably businessmen
I sense good taste, and they watch us, the spots an expensive place
Manhattan New York, I'm try'na keep steamin'
It's good for the lungs, had plans for the evening
This man leans in, his boys laughing
Now I'm the spokesperson for Black men, this always happens
Says, "Since all Black women care about is who got dough
And all we do is call them either bitch or a Black hoe"
I say first brotha you ain't gotta be that cold
Since you ignorant, I'ma show you how the facts go
The biggest example in scandal of history
Were Monica Lewinksy or Donald Trump's pimping spree
Most woman who love Jeevanji of Gucci
Are pretentious non-Black groupies or floozies
But who are we to blame, not the dames
It's a man-made game, in essence our woman the same
Beautiful creatures, Black girls birthed the earth
So they deserve to earn man's purse
Matter fact, I'm about to go shopping with my dime
Catch you cowards the next time, the next rhyme, uh

[Chorus: Kelis singing]
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
([Nas:] That's the American way)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
([Nas:] Cause that's the American way.    What up, K?)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
([Nas:] That's the American way)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way, shit
([Nas:] Ha, yeah)

I don't care about the runaways
I don't care about who's gay
I don't care about dying of AIDS
But I care if I got paid
Who even cares about the president?
I think they're making a mistake
I don't care about the hurricane
As long as my family's safe
I don't care about the candidates
They burnt this country to bits
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way ([Nas:] Uh)

Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: And ya don't s , uh)
Can we make a change
You know it's not overnight
Let's start the fight (Nas: Yeah)
Yeah I think about this everyday, that's the American Way

[Sample - Nas: Nas is a rebel to America!]








[Nas:] "This ain't for everybody. Y'all know who y'all are
Yeah you, y'all know who y'all are. These are our heroes."

[Chorus: Nas]
Let's hear it, one for the coons on UPN 9 and WB
Who 'Yes Massa' on TV, what ever happened to Wheezy? The Red Fox's?
Never got Emmy's but were real to me
Let's hear it, two for the spooks who do cartwheels
'Cause they said they played they parts well
Now they claim caviar, hate that oxtail
Lambda Sigma Phi badge on lapel
Whitey always tell him, "Ooh, he speak so well"
Are you the one we look to, the decent Negro?
The acceptable Negro -- hell nah
But they say, "These are our heroes"

    
Uh, Massa used to breed us to be bigger to go play
Athletes of today in the NBA, make me proud
But there's somethin' they don't say
Keep gettin' accused for abusin' White pussay
From OJ to Kobe, uh let's call him Tobe
First he played his life cool just like Michael
Now he rock ice too just like I do
Yo, you can't do better than that?
The hotel clerk who adjusts the bathroom mat?
Now you lose sponsorships that you thought had your back
Yeah, you beat the rap jiggaboo, fake nigga you
You turn around then you shit on Shaq
Who woulda knew, Mr. Goodie-Two-Shoes
He love a little butt crack, got enough cash
Little kids with they bus pass who look up to you
To do something for the youth, stupid spoof
But you let them use you as an example
They would rep, but our heroes got they hands full



    
You Homey The Clown, bowtie, apple pie, Bo Jangles
But we love Bo Jangles, we know what he came through
But what's your excuse, duke? You talk Black
but your album sound like you give your nuts for a plaque
You don't ride for the facts like um, say Scarface
You don't know what you feel, y'all too safe
Election done came and went, y'all worked so hard for it
Huh, and in the end we all got dicked
These are our heroes, thanks a lot public school systems still rot
Still harassed by cops, snitches on blocks
Sellin they peoples out - some real folks with clout
Tavis Smiley, Michael Eric Dyson
Stokely Carmichael, let's try to be like them
Nicky Giovanni poetical black female
Jim Brown to the people who sing well from
Fela to Miriam Makeba
The mirror says you are the next American leader
So don't be, acceptin new 'We are the World' records
These pickaninnies get with anything to sell records
Cause it's trendy to be the conscious MC
But next year, who knows what we'll see?
Ha-Ha, these are our heroes



[Nas:] "Yeah, I wanna give a special shoutout to the -- y'know
the crew doin' they thing out there reppin' us hard
Big up to Tiger Woods.    Yeah, ya don't s .    Big up
to Cuba Gooding Jr.    Y'know, yeah, y'know.    Tay Diggs
what up my nigga.    Yeah, ha-ha.    And you don't quit

[Male Heckler:] "Yeah-Yeah, what you doin' for the hood though
homie? What you doin' for the hood, man? Look at
all that paper.    Drivin' around like a playboy in
my hood.    What type of shit is that?"

[overlapping dialogue]

[Nas:] "I'm outta here.    Please, excuse me, 'xcuse me -- please
Let me get to my limousine, I'm outta here.    I know, I
got a plane to catch.    And I love you back.    Ha-Ha
yeah yeah -- And I'm outta here.    A-ha-ha -- PEACE."

[Thug Heckler:] "Come on nigga, give back to the hood.    Cocky
motherf*cker!"


  "Two- -four, yeah.    L, whattup?"

Word to mama, any lineup of rhymers
Could bring any drama, anytime, the city's mine
Nas Is Like, Love Undying, Money's My Bitch
In Thugz Mansion, thugs dancin' around the fly shit
Pharaoh garment's Prada, Egyptian camelback-riders
Pyramid architects, Perignon bottles, money, jewelry want me to come
Get me, hit me but don't miss me, you history
Lead flowin' around like a Frisbee, Italian dons from Sicily kiss me
This ain't 50, this ain't Jigga, this ain't Diddy, this ain't Pretty
Pain, power, pussy and pistols, lyrically no one, hold none near me, hear me
Kids cheer me like The Count of Monte-Cristo
Steady poundin' soundin' like G without the lisp though
My big bro told me plain and simple, "Nas do not look back"
Watch where you took rap, no bookbags and trucker hats
Just army jacks and diamonds that's flashin'
What the f*ck is that, freestyle

Like Paul, Michael and Matthew, Peter, James and Andrew
Phillip, Simon and Judas -- I'm disciple of music
Street beats is the main thing minus the traitor
And I'm not a dictator, I'm the righteous invitin' you haters
Inside the life of the greatest, it'll take you through something real
Get a smack in your face, 'cause I hurt up, trauma-tize, llama
Bust shells, destroy yet try'ta prevent violence
If I present iron somebody dyin', don't even worry 'bout it
Then dress warm for the cemetery climate
When I speak I need cemetery silence, terror
See me, gold Hummers, Lamborghinis, man who stole the summer
Hand straight gleamin', if I don't know you toe-tag you
Drag you through the cement, fo-fo maggie
Body parts in my man's Maserati car, then party hard in Madagascar
While rigor mortis'll grab ya, him retarded, I'm pass that
Gloves on, where the mask at? Too many love songs
All the thugs gone, what happened? Where's the passion?
Rappers battlin' non-rappers, carryin' on backwards
Laughin' sayin' Nas thinks he's Farrakhan preachin' blackness
Hell yeah, awareness is my alias
Word to the 'Braveheart' written on my bare chest
The realest, HERE IT IS!

[Chorus: Nas & L.E.S.]

Uh, I knew a few pharmacists, f*ck frozen
They kept pneumonias on their arms and wrists
The main dude, Sekou, face look hard as shit
Remember like yesterday, they were the kings of ecstacy
Kept sellin' it, he blends in everywhere, has a mixed heritage
Bitches let him hit on the reg', waterbed seats in his car
All red ferari, Florida where we met at a redlight
Homeboy bumpin' my old shit
They wildin' with some freaks from the islands
piled in behind him, limosine, Benz
He shouted, "Nas, roll with us"
I'm bored so I followed him
Nikki Beach, here's where the scene begins
He put me on to Don, nice ass with a set of mean twins
Had a pocket full of cash, Sekou wasn't lettin' me spend
I was there for the weekend, packed and prepared for anything
Then he brings me to his castle in Coconut Grove
War stories about dudes both of us know
Never heard drunken words spoken so slow
A year go by, the nigga was fly
Prada shoes, a lotta jewelry, stayed high
Got a call, he's in N.Y
Needs a couple of G's 'til tomorrow, I dips by
for a season where he's at
Greets me with a smile, told him "Here keep that"
Next week got a call from his wife
Said somebody done took son life
[beat changes]
She said

[Nas as Scarlett - repeat 2X]
"Who gon' hold me down now? Hold me down now
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now?
Who gon' hold me down now? Who gon' hold me down?
Tell me that huh -- who gon' hold me down now"

[Nas as Scarlett]
Forget about them other dudes, they talkin' to me rude
'Cause I always knew the truth, they hated Sekou
H2 full of holes, the drove him off the road
Left him there on this 'cain, clothes stained with his brain
My soul shattered, my man's toe's tagged up
Arrangement's a closed casket
See now a hoe has to, maintain with his fake gang
sheddin' fake tears, I won't have it
Look, this kid's Jamaican -- half Hatian, half Asian
Brag about how the streets needed a changin'
Son, you the only one a bitch could call
You remind me of my dude, help me get them all

[Nas:] "Di-sci-ple" [scratched by DJ 3X]
[Scarlett:] "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"
[Nas:] "Di-sci-ple" [scratched by DJ 3X]
[Scarlett:] "You remind me of my dude, help me get them all"



Live now niggaz, there's no promise of a second time around, put it down
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, we spending
Not under the ground yet, we enjoying every second yo
Live now, don't forget to bro, yeah
cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

Picture my last days will be so grim
My daughter at my bedside, respirator in me
Eyes dilated, looking skinny, trying to smile, trying to say something
Whole room will quiet down just to hear my last words
Tears fall down my facial, why fear anything, it's now too late to
I'm dreaming of a time I was silked out at the peak of my career
But I always choked out, leaving mad money on the table at crazy amounts
I would hit the scene for a second and bounce
Admit I did live a little bit, sweet pickle dick
Freaks licked on it, lips I dripped on it
Sex, I dropped pearl necklaces on necks and tits
Traveled half the world, wish I traveled the rest of it
From QB to Mecca kid, so if you knew me
You'd be proud to say I left you with enough memories to resurrect me with
So live now nigga



[Scarlett]
It's been a long time since you came through to see ya sis
You know I love you, I've been a fan since Genesis
Gotta respect you 'cause you never tied to smash
Since we met a while back, and your style was mack
Now I see that you a man after all you been through
A stand-up dude, held me down after Sekou
Need more brothers like you in the hood, would have wifed you if I could
But the white cells in my blood were no good
Said I had it ten years, but I was just a carrier
I thought, "Me a victim?", could never be my character
It's ill Se' passed the way he did, didn't know how to tell him
Just happy it didn't get in our kid
But all the things I did was the flyest, experiences were priceless
Remember days of diamond cuts
Nugget rings, clubs in Queens, Jetta cars
Used to love them things, Barbados, Belize
I stayed over seas, shopping sprees, credit cards
Pockets of Gs, left the hood, phattest cribs
To platinum from silver, came back, bitches calling me the black Liz Taylor
Imagine that, Rob me? My nigga would kill ya, they knew the rules
All the planes I flew, niggaz I ran through
Lot of unprotected sex, don't know where it came from
Grimy niggaz, rich niggaz, damn it ain't a game son
From the Cayman Islands to the Virgin Islands
Gucci suitcases (coughs), a chic did it, eff the screw faces
Critics and fans, they need to get a life
You doin' the right thing, settle down, get a wife now
I grew with you so you know you make me proud
And most of all you gotta live now

[Chorus: Scarlett]
Live now nigga ain't no promise of a second time around, put it down, would you
We'll just live now, there's no reason why you shouldn't, everything is up to you
All you gotta do is just, live now, keep spending
Not under the ground yet, keep enjoying every minute yo
Gotta live it up to the limit yo
cause I promise you you'll regret it bro

[Scarlett]
Son, come close, lemme talk to you
I got music, put it out to the world, let 'em hear it
Look out for little me, one



[Chorus: Amerie singing]
The rest of my life
The rest of my life

    
LIFE, dead presidents, devilish meant
Overthrow king thrones just 'cause of their negligence
DEATH, real shit'll start comin' to light
Niggaz you ain't like dickin' your wife, WHAT?
Kind and underminding, grimy, stiff corpse shapin'
Pork bacon, double-cross Satan
HEATHENS, non-god-fearing, lace thong wearing demons
But glory go to God, y'all BENEATH HIM
If y'all don't know that, rap with a old cat
He'll show you streets where them big dealers DROVE AT
Where low-key killers let the fo' clap
Blocka-blocka-blocka -- OH
The glow, the 'dro, the dough for shows
Everything a hood brother thing he needs -- YO
You'll find a goal in a ghetto superstar's roadmap
And I'ma use that for the

[Amerie singing]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

    
Burnt-out, kicked to the curb
So I had to learn how to turn around a hundred thou' REAL FAST
In '95 that was my last, I went back to the ave thinkin' rap's a thing of the PAST
Rest in peace E Money Bags, no more cabs, got caught with the ratchet in the stash
Lawyer want CASH, my ba'y bro blast burners at cats who gell
They burnt a range with a mollet of COCKTAIL
My little man got fourteen-years for car-jackin' a undercover
Them cops SWEAR, my little nigga told on me
I'm thinkin, "Hello, where's the L-O, V-E"
Pigs play games, my little man'll never say names
Word to his pops with elephant veins
They both locked-up still, word to Will
I'll make it and chill for the

[Chorus: Amerie singing]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life

    
My man gave his mommy coke
So she wouldn't hit the block all crazy for the smoke
DAMN NIGGA, could you picture you supplyin' your own moms
so she don't have to bone for DIMES?
Or give dome for nicks' in the roofs of the projects
where dogs shit and PISS
Yeah, we all plan to get rich but it's all about how it's executed
Lexus coup-ed, brigettes from cubics
Mighta been stupid, but I got far from twenty-six BARS
To ten LP's, what can him tell me? Of them? Of y'all?
I'M NAS, on a track that's unorthodox
Like my life coulda been offed by THE COPS
Told y'all, Nas will prevail by the book when it's up for sale
About the rest

[Chorus: Amerie singing]
For the rest of my life
For the rest of my life





[Verse 1: Quan]
Can we please have a moment of silence?
That's for my niggaz doin' years in confinement
And for my soldiers who passed over, no longer living
That couldn't run whenever the reaper came to get 'em
Can we please pour out some liquor?
Symobolizin', let's take in time to consider that
Though our thugs ain't here, the love is here
And we gon' rep 'til slugs kill us here
This for my dawgs stuck in the struggle tryin' to gain
Smokin' trauma, sniffin' Ra while sellin' cocaine
Trapped in the game, not knowin' how to s  and get by
To live it alive, so instead they live it to die
Can we please have a moment of peace?
For every G that fell for his flag in the streets
Bloodin' and thuggin', folkin' and lokin'
Crypin' and creepin', Latin and kingin'
Or just for poor righteous teachin'

[Chorus: Quan sings]
As days goes and nights fall
For the rest of our life we'll miss y'all
And even though life must go on, we'll still mourn
While wishin' y'all were home

    
Yeah, and can we have another moment of silence?
For brothers who died from black-on-black violence
From here to the Dark Continent were rebels sell diamonds
To clients allover the world, got little Black girls dyin'
And can we please pour some more liquors?
For Will, Bokeem, Bar, Pappy -- my niggaz
Here's another Warrior Song from Nasty and Quan
It's to him I pass the baton to carry this on
Street's Disciple, salute to those who's gone with bullets
And I promise through rhymin' Quan gon' rep his life to the fullest
And can we please have a moment of truth?
For soldiers and troops away with helmets and boots
And families back home who pray they make it home safe
Hopin' that they don't get hit with a stray or missiles
This is just a moment to let you all know that we miss you
Mommy I'm still here, wishin' I was there with you
Let's take 'em home



[Verse 3: Quan]
And can we please have a moment to mourn?
For Pac, Biggie and Pun 'cause through us they live on
Jam Master Jay, Freaky Ty and Alliyah
Big L and Left Eye, when we die we wish to see ya
Can we please have a moment for children?
Who got raped or murdered, or trapped in the system
Who never knew their father, never learned to dream
But was guided by drug dealers, killers and crack fiends
For single mothers that's forced to play mom and dad
Bustin' her ass to give her kids shit she never had
For my niggaz in the pen hopin' rhymes'll get 'em signed
So when released, they can say bye to a life of crime
For very mother that held a son in the street bleedin'
Cryin' a song of sorow to dark and deep for speakin'
Just a moment outside the day to day struggle
To let the ones we really care about know that we love 'em




[Chorus: Woman singing]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?

    
By the time of age nine I'm already decidin'
If I can protect mommy from the hood by fightin'
Or usin' a knife or a gun when I'm twenty-one
By by then them hoods woulda pushed their way in our apartment
And we die then, so I been a young nervous wreck in the projects
Watchin' them older niggaz pass pot and they high man
I'm just a young boy, snot nose, hair nappy
Cops ride by squeezin' their trigger fingers at me
So I would go to school and try to get good grades
Teacher wrote mommy and kicked me outta school for havin' braids
So she cussed them, said "My son ain't no motherf*ckin' hoodlum"
They judged us, thinking that we dumb 'cause where we come from
Got a little older and now I see
Young niggaz wanted by the powers that be (powers that be)

[Chorus: Woman singing]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

    
Uh, picture a Black nanny and a baby in a basket pushin' down 5th Ave
She never had it, it's not hers to begin with
She gives it breakfast, baths and dinners
Treats it so tender while her own kids live alone at home with no phone on
Ain't had a good meal in so long, but so long as mommy's a maid
Cookin' and cleanin', she wanna feed her kids and her kids are dreamin'
Where's my daddy, who's my daddy, have you seen him?
I could imagine them askin', what type of human be-ing
Could leave his family, go back to the Carribean?
Was he locked up, shot up, does he have freedom?
Mom said wipe your tears, keep readin'
But daddy's somewhere, spirit broken, feelin' defeated
A man feels he has to conquer all
The world is his oyster, his pearl so y'all know

[Chorus: Woman singing]
I can't find no reason why we can't all live in peace
'Cause this world keeps spinning, yet still I wonder what's the reason

I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
When you're workin' hard but there ain't nothin' comin'
What's the reason?
Oooh-whoa-ooh-whoa

    
I know a girl, her boyfriend was a fugitive
She's intuitive, be on some stupid shit
She called the cops 'cause she hated his mother
Now he away doin' numbers, now she gay with her lover
How many niggaz gon' die this summer?
I pump life in my music, but still life is a wonder
There's a officer in a squad car, he's a prostitute serial killer
It's odd, huh? 'Cause he's the same cop in church with his wife
He's molestin' his son and she ignores it at night
Little bad ass bastard, lights a match and kills Betty Shabazz
in her pad while she slept
They said Prescott Bush funded Hitler while the world's in a twister
Nigga, what you expect? Imagine what's next

[Chorus: Woman singing]
I see people hating other people
Tell me what's the reason
That your kid is hungry, you ain't got no money
What's the reason?
For these wars we're fighting with each other
Season after season
When you're workin' hard, but there ain't nothing comin'
What's the reason?

[Woman harmonizes as Nas talks:]
"Uh, uh, man, man'll search the whole planet, looking for what
Try to conquer all.    So what? To all my niggaz with they
kids that love they kids, man.    All the daddies out there
To all the niggaz that died tryin'a figure out what's what
Tryin'a be the biggest of the big, you know.    Yeah, yeah
Ladies forgive us.    Gotta forgive us.    For we know not what
we do.    Breakin' hearts, leavin' the crib, buggin' out and
shit.    Just man... man."

    
Cup'a Hen', cup'a Goose, cup'a Cris'
White chain, colored watch on the wrist
Switch lanes in monster whips, ambience
Specially dressed, guess who? -- Nas, it's obvious
Step to bars, we just ordered dark liquors
Clear liquors, y'all niggaz are s-e-x
Yes we get respected, eclectic messages
Left our brains, get into a female's estrogen
She feels electric, her breasts she touchin' them
Wet 'tween the legs from this thug seduction
N-a-s, then they ass, over-spank it
Whisperin' she loves intelligent gangstas
Call fatties 'bubbles', call head 'skull'
Before I get either I need some Red Bull
She'll scream as I pushed in her freezing cold pool
When she piss she gon' bleed in the whole stool
That's how much I wanna bang and touch her pretty thing
Won't pluck no chicken wing, don't f*ck with just anything
Gotta come up, run up and get touched up
Suicide, that's if you confront us

[Chorus I: Nas]
Don't talk, just hold your breath
Been here a while, s'only one nigga left
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile

Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song

    
Uh, from a boy to a king
Love to rock diamonds and fancy rings
I'm a thoroughbred, real heavy mang
I'm f*ckin' something tonight that's on everything
Fellas who beat bodies with me
Kidnappers and stick-up kids, they all poli' with me
Pop bottles with me, button-up shirts and throwbacks
Those cats only roll when I'm in the city
And the dance floor is disgustin'
Move your waistline to the basic percussion
I'm that, cool laid-back don who won't say nuttin'
And laugh when a nigga start frontin'

[Chorus II: Nas]
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile
Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang

You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song

Bass beat bang [2X]
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song

    
Rock Tims, rock Chucks, rock Bapes
I like eyes, pretty lips, fly face
First you said you would spread for me in an instant
See me with the next chick, now you act different
Power of the stick shift, now I embarrass her
Play your position, you're way outta character
Do the knowledge, graduated hood college with honors
Pay homage to Nas, Dickies and Converse
On her eyes shades in the nighttime regardless
The army's so thick you can't harm us

[Chorus III: Nas]
And all'a y'all know my style
I spend dough but I still let it pile

Mama shake ya thing
Coochie get wet while the bass beat bang
You put it on and on and on and on
Everybody talkin' 'bout the new Nas song





[Busta Rhymes]
Ay fellas
I think you might wanna s-s-sneak your ratchet in here for this one
Ay ladies
Put your petroleum jelly on your face
Yo Nas, we got a big bet in the streets
that you knock they ass out in the first 30 seconds of the first round
GET 'EM!

[Verse One: Nas]
Sittin up drunk, shufflin thoughts
Got paper but I'm lost
Losin focus what a nigga still hustlin for
My seed is straight, the fam is settled
Idle time get the man in trouble
When wifey tourin, my life get boring
Start to remember all types of torment
The devil's callin, but I don't answer
Mom passed from cancer, leavin behind
two granddaughters, two grandsons, two 9's
next to me in the Phantom, who lyin?
Big screen documentaries of Idi Amin
Gotta, try to stay away from creeps
With they bullshit, tryin to put me back in the streets
War stories, funerals
where feds be layin from a dreadful slayin
Body viewing's at the wake
Nigga sit stiff in his Ferrari, no casket
with his eyelids still open, it's kinda spooky
Iceman watch on, the suit Gucci
I'm above the standard
But dude just Mar-salis than Branford
Thinkin you're too rich, they wanna gun ya
Kidnap ya cause of they hunger, but you f*ckin with hunters
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit
Camoflauged in black hoods that dump clips
Cause real niggaz die over dumb shit

[Chorus 2X: Busta Rhymes]
Fight, fists, dance, suckah
Suicide, bounce, brother
Ice, whips, cash, nigga
Watch yo', big, ass, momma

[Verse Two: Nas]
To your, power structure, Nas is dangerous
Y'all the antithesis, the opposite
Twitchin shit, all up in your body language
Mean muggin your bitch, cause she leans over
to look closer told you y'all sloppy gangsters sayin
"Nas is this and Nas is that"
Your eyes go front, your eyes go back
Surprised I'm at the same place y'all be at
It's obvious you don't know how I react
Like, I don't know where the party's at
You're foamin at the mouth, losin breath
Like a cardiac arrest, but I ain't impressed
Cause the fact is, y'all don't really want it
Two to the head, fo' to the stomach
Call more security cause I come off
anywhere you at you scary cats
If you dare squeeze back, guns shall rain
a thousand times harder than when I first came
Y'all not relentless, y'all dumb
And y'all just forgot about the consequences
Not a jail sentence, but see
the nigga you feed'll kick it to dude that kick it to me
We posess, the recipes for death, cause jealousy destroys
Feed the dog first, watch out for salmonella poisoning
I know a kid who'll throw shit in your food
And say, "That's the way you kill a man, avoid the shooting"
Hey...




You smile, in my face
Secretly I know, you want my place
You waitin on me to choke, don't want a nigga to breathe
You wanna come cut my throat, you wanna get rid of me
But before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe
Before I let it happen them guns gon' start clappin
And y'all gon' rest in peace, cause death is the recipe

[Busta] Suicide, bounce, brother
[Busta] Suicide, bounce, brother
[Busta] Suicide, bounce, brother
[Busta] Suicide, bounce, brother



















One...two...yeah...huh...Nasir

[Chorus: Nas]
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand 
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand 
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo 
We sippin' on Merlot
You ain't got be my girl though 
I'll drop you off at Woolabee and Merdo
Smash with the Virgo
Ain't got to take your shirt off    
But see me convince your homegirl though 

 
Uh, she says some life is too hard
She says that she wanna come build and with the god 
Promise me that she gonna play her part 
Cuz what I spit gets straight to her heart 
And she damn fine, feet hammertime 
Damn if I mind 
Long as the butt bubble in back of your waistline
I don't waste time, I gotta get-get on it 
Just you and me, two glasses....
In the club scene where I met Miss Green Eyes 
She walked by asking me "Are you Nas?"
"Why?" 
"If you was I'd be totally T.W.I"
"What's that?"
"Totally With It. T.W.I" 
"Ha, well here I am"
"Yep, I'm the man"
"Bartender, put a Cosmo in that girl hand"
So here we standin' before I begin
Homegirl made a knot out of the cherry stem 
Tongue skills, yea I like that
Now we on the right track 
Straight to my Phantom called 'Africa Black'
Ever since then, she been yappin' her track
Told her friends now they hollerin' behind her back 
Sing

[Chorus - Nas]
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand 
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand 
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo 
We sippin' on Merlot
You ain't got be my girl though 
I'll drop you off at Woolabee and Merdo
Smash with the Virgo
Ain't got to take your shirt off    
But see me convince your homegirl though

[Ludacris]
Now I was so fresh and so fly in diamonds
When I stepped up in the club even my eyes was shinin, "bling!"
A little cute thing said, "What's your name?"
I put my necklace in her face and told her "Read the chain"
Ooh, ooh so stuck up
Told me "Shut the f*ck up"
Blow! Ludacris is in the hot Luke house
The needle hit the record, they was playin this song
All the ladies hit the floor and it was uh-uh on
Live forever like 'Fame', let the Leroys dance 
While I'm laid back chillin in my b-boy stance 
Could be a little pop lockin if your girl's  s droppin 
But watch for cock blockin all my coochie stock options 
But later for that NASDAQ throw 'em on the fast track 
Make 'em swip-swap Nasty N.A.S pass that 
Honey in the black cuz I'm feelin her curves 
She looked down and what I had is that wa-wa word 
Why only serve one when you can serve up two
Then at the bachelor's pad doin what the Virgos do 
And these women so shy, but get loud undercover
So we can have sex, but I can't be your lover! 
Sing

[Chorus - Ludacris]
Baby girl won't you come and hold my hand 
Won't you come and just chill with the Virgo
Hey girl, just come and hold my hand 
Won't you come and chill out with the Virgo 
We sippin' on Merlot
You ain't got be my girl though 
I'll drop you off at Peachtree and Merlot
Smash with the Virgo
Ain't got to take your shirt off    
But see me convince your homegirl though


 
I think I can remember some...

Brenda the back-bender used to have me in the twister
Grabbed her up and left her at the Buena Vista
Chelsea used to tell me choke her while I stroke her
Stuck a Heineken bottle up in the ass, a real joker
Used to run my bubble bath, tons of laughs, sexy chick
Mad skills, she used to try to eat my excrement
Used to play Atari 1200, baby-sitter made me kiss her
Put hickeys on her stomach
Toya was a tomboy 'til we played catch a screw
Had her out past her curfew, Sheila had this perfume
that drove a nigga wild, was a child then, Gertrude
used to put my face in her crotch
Spun my tongue around in a circle while she watched
Eiserea knew I was a player, brought Fatima, loud screamer
While I blew clouds of reefer, they sucked juice out my uretha
While Marvin Gaye pumped from the speaker


Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I f*cked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I f*cked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you

 
Was only scared of them STDs, syphilis, VD and herpes
Daffy Duck-lookin' bitch burnt me, correction
Urinary tract infection, what I got for no protection
Was a horny dog, mornings waking up with a log
Dick stuck to my draws, wet dreams in the mind
Of a one-of-a-kind sex fiend, Justine was luscious wanna cuff us when f*cked us
Me and her best friend, this thick Texan named Tamika, English teacher
Wedding ring on finger, bent her big ass over the fold-out sofa
The weather was cold and Loretta would throw on nothing but a thong
Under the coat and
Put a show on just to show me she loved me
She would undress and wait in zero below weather
In slippers and a sun dress for me to arrive
Kept a freak in the ride with her head in my lap, the steering wheel's high


Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I f*cked a few
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I f*cked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you

 
Thank God I got bank god, so f*ck pimpin'
F*ck broke condoms, pills and penicillin
Abortion clinics, I was one of the best who did it
Lesbian shit, wheelchair girls and midgets
Twin sisters, cousins, mothers and daughters, some wasn't no quarters
Long chin, some with funny odors
Long blond weaves, overweight, cottage cheese
Some I paid college fees, then they strip tease
And it's sad I don't remember great times that made me drool
And the sex gave me flashbacks when I was like eww
Mature with it now dog, here's the side of Nas
Principles are lined up, things prioritized
Se mamma I left that alone, faded memories, the reason that I'm grown
It'd be senseless for us to lie about our old experiences, no longer
are we tempted


Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I f*cked a few
(now we could properly begin this)
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, and all the wild things I used to do
Remember the times I hung with the dimes, remember the times I f*cked a few
Remembering the times it was on my mind, but none of them could touch you


I know you think you got it together player, but f*ck the bird you with
And listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
Listen close to the makings of a perfect bitch
There's always one thing wrong and you wish that you could switch
Or fix, while you shapin' every curve and hips, you heard of this?
The makings of a perfect bitch

 
A ghoul at night, I role like Jack the Ripper trying to choose my wife
I need a ass of a stripper, fat lipper
Mad niggaz in this one predicament
You try to choose a loyal one and stick with it
My stupid dick again searching for something to jump and then start humpin'
Convincing me that the history of a woman is about leaving a nigga with nothing
So my experiences taught me how to come up with a plan to make a right one for the man
A toy for the boy, the one that righteously will understand
And since I can't find her I guess I gotta make her
I creep in the night like a kinky undertaker
I think I'm on a caper to abduct a nerd from the Ivy League
Next s  at the strip club snatch a bad one and flee
What's next, I'm stakin' out a five star restaurant to kidnap the chef
Say goodbye to the stress



 
I stitch 'em together then I kiss 'em forever
These surgical gloves are made of love, couldn't be better
Four cycles of blood, child birth first
Men-e-stral cycle, last men-e-stral cycle then death
That's four, so I guess rebirth is the fifth
Put 'em together, that's a genius, a slut and a chef
Holdin' the scalpel while cutting the flesh
Heavy bleeding, so I need suction, it's such a mess
If she survives she'll be sucking me next
Dark nipples on her D-cup breasts so I could titty f*ck while she do
my taxes for the IRS
So I could just relax, shit, by now I'm blessed
I'm her daddy, I'm her messiah, I'm god
Cause I injected obedience and loyalty in her heart
Know you mad cause you with a bitch that nag you to death
I smack mine on the ass and she breathe her first breath



 
Gimme Sade's mystique, she gotta know her way in the streets
Like Billie Holiday in Harlem
Body from Ketoi Johnson and Kenya Moore and Apple Bottoms
Maya Angelou's brain and some groove from Terry McMillan
Them Angelina Jolie lips, Angela Davis, Sista Souljah's wit
Helping me load clips
Some words form a pimp was, "Nas, it just don't exist"
But homes is twisted, a home ain't a home without without the misses
All the girls that I named are queens, no disrespect
But I need me someone to disappear, reappear like I dream of Jeannie
Whenever I want, I think I met her, it's on, forever I'll flaunt


Say hello to the man, goodbye to the gigolo
It was difficult for me to find a chick I want

 
This ain't no sucka for love shit
This ain't no Huxtable kisses and hug shit, first night we f*ck shit
And don't call the next day, this a thug's wedding day
And love, will we make it? Let us pray...
In a limo, my niggas, my father, my brothers
Everybody in tuxes gettin' blunted
Hard Bottasmov costumes, this ain't no act, though
Factual, the pimp shall scoop no more
Yes, I'm absolutely sure
I know that she love me, I know that she faithful
We spoke on a prenuptial agreement cuz Will and Jada ain't need it
Spoke on eloping but then I deaded the thought
Cuz she deserves Cinderella's Ball and the whole shit
But know this, you f*ckin' wit a slit ya throat quick
Behicular explosions, cigar smokin'
Dark-minded, chart climbin, well-spoken
Safer world of broke men to rich ones
Throw them phone numbers away cuz this is it, hun
Headed to the Chapel, my niggas laughin
And it's bafflin cuz just a year ago
It's weird, though, I knew I'd get married
To who? I knew not, thought of snatchin Halle up from the dreadlock
Pumpin' Sade, my head knot
Finally, I met the perfect bitch, pardon my french, rephrase that 
Someone who made my heart s , couldn't wait to blaze that
Tired of hoppin' from honey to honey
HIV spreadin', everybody bump the same bunnies
The game'll put niggas in they graves right before they part ways with the street
I want a son to greet every mornin'
Daughters and more sons tickle my feet
Wife smilin', tellin' me it's time to eat
I'm gettin' married

[Chorus x3]

 
It was my dream for my queen to put the ring on the ride
Even Marrin Luther King had a fling on the side
That's what the negative ones say
Knew my wedding would be one day but quickly is this day
I know the hoes gonna miss me
Lookin' at old photos, sayin, "Damn, used to twist me"
Start chokin' up since I woke up
Bachelor Party was crazy, tryin' hard just to sober up
Father saw me in a daze, knudged me with his left arm
Told me how him and moms went to City Hall, dressed norm'
Said she would love me and my eyes were boating
Customized in London by guys who suit up kings
Gov', you got the ring, Jung', you behave
Maxwell, he gon' sing, invited Lauryn Hill and the gang
Baltimore, North Cacky', Mississippi
Family packed in, my nigga, L is crazy tipsy
Spilled Pepsi on the cufflinks, ginger ale got it out
Watched in the church, just all big to thug it out
My girl walked in glistenin', different stones
'Bout to go from my fiance to Mrs. Jones
That's a union nobody can touch
I gotta be cool wit' ya crazy aunts and uncles
Cuz I love you much...cuz you put up wit my shit
Court cases, baby mommas
I make an honest woman outta you yet
Everybody starin' at you, I'm at the alter, standin'
Heart poundin' out my chest like a cannon
I'm happy, one of my Groom's men
Under the music says, "Don't do it"
But they just joke, some crew shit
They playin, I'm gleeful, I'm stayin'
I'm sayin' vows that are all true
"Will you take music as your wedded wife?"
"I do."
Sike, this ain't about music, y'all know who I'm talkin' to

Gettin' married

[Chorus x3]


[Maxwell]
Oooooooooooh!
 
Maxwell go and sing
[Maxwell]
Ooohh, this for the ladies
 
M-A-X
[Maxwell]
Doin' it
 
N-A-S
[Maxwell]
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again (who's back)
Ooh, tell me (who's back)
I'm back again (who's back)
Again, again, I'm back again

 
Uh, yeah the booty is the bass
The highs, the beauty in ya eyes
First glance I became alive
She went through a lot of dangerous guys, surprise
Now she went to side on Nas
Cause I ain't choose her, she chose me
In the party, it was a early day a March
When I first had ya legs arched
In the park, wasn't even dark
We was in the zone, we ain't care who watch
Baby was ?? though the trees was sparked
She said till you get enough, please don't s 
So I played wit it, got the moist spot hot
If I ain't hittin' the bottom, I'm getting some  
My hair cut look air brushed
Whatever I wear is straight plush from the ears to chucks
As we ?? across the dance floor
Just, me and you no one else but us to

[Maxwell]
No other girl in the room
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl lookin' as good as you)
There's nobody but you
(They can try, they can try)
No other girl in the room
(But you know, you know, you know)
No other girl in the room
(Oh, oh, ooo ooo)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl, no)
There's nobody but you
(They try)
No other girl in the room
(There's nobody to,)

 
In the early eighties, shorty had me off the wall
A super freak as my thoughts revolved
It's like a menage Winona Gaye and Leila Hathaway
Both they fathers a tell me to play, sip ??
On our honeymoon everyday
We dance to the same tune everyday
Beauty and the goon they would say
You promise, savage beast
You a sexy freak
Your moist lips negates the ecstacy
Number one in my book, no discrepancy
When you walk on the earth, you be reppin' me
I'm obsessed with thee, cherish every breath you breathe
No matter what's going on around us
All I could hear was the sound of (her)
Twirlin' her around just (her)
See nobody in the crowd just (her)

[Maxwell]
(No other)
No other girl in the room
(No one)
No other girl in the room but you
(There's no other girl)
There's nobody but you
(Thinkin' about you baby, baby)
No other girl in the room
(Never ever, ever, ever, see you)
No other girl in the room
(Oh)
No other girl in the room but you
(No other girl has, they're not you)
There's nobody but you
(Oooh baby yeah)
No other girl in the room

 
Uh, horns!
Clap
Everybody clap
C'mon, clap
Max mellow I'm out

[Maxwell]
Oh it's just my, it's just my, it's just my girl
Oh, it's just, just my, just my baby, you
Just you, just me, no one else but you
No one, no one, just me and you, oh babe

 
Clap!    Break it down

[Olu Dara]
You know it all comes from Africa
But my version is the blues


"The light is there."

[Intro: Olu Dara singing]
See I come from Mississippi
I was young and runnin' wild
Ended up in New York City, where I had my first child
I named the boy Nasir, all the boys call him Nas
I told him as a youngster, he'll be the greatest man alive

    
Let's go!... Hey-Hey-Hey-Hey -- 
Tribrary of these rap skits, styles I mastered
Many brothers snatched it up and tried to match it
But I'm still number one, everyday real
Speak what I want, I don't care what y'all feel
'Cause I'm my own master, my Pop told me be your own boss
Keep integrity at every cost, and his home was Natchez Mississippi
Did it like Miles and Dizzy, now we gettin' busy
Bridging The Gap from the blues, to jazz, to rap
The history of music on this track
Born in the game, discovered my father's music 
Like Prince searchin' through boxes of Purple Rain
But my Minneapolis was The Bridge, home of the Superkids
Some are well-known, some doin' bids
I mighta ended up on the wrong side of the tracks
If Pops wouldn't've pulled me back an said yo
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man alive (Nas: Yeah, turn it up!)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!

    
The blues came from gospel, gospel from blues
Slaves are harmonizin' them ah's and ooh's
Old school, new school, know school rules
All these years I been voicin' my blues
I'm a artist from the start, Hip-Hop guided my heart
Graffiti on the wall, coulda ended in Spoffard, juvenile delinquent
But Pops gave me the right type'a tools to think with
Books to read, like X and stuff
'Cause the schools said the kids had dyslexia
In art class I was a compulsive sketcher of
Teachers in my homeroom, I drew pix to mess them up
'Cause none'a them would like my style
Read more books than the curriculum profile
Said, "Mr. Jones please come get your child
'Cause he's writin' mad poems and his verses are wild"
[Olu Dara singing]
Greatest man ? The great-greatest man alive

    
Hey-Hey-Hey -- My Poppa was not a Rollin' Stone
He been around the world blowin' his horn, still he came home
Then he got grown, changed his name to Olu
Come on, tell 'em 'bout the places you gone to
[Olu Dara singing]
I been to Saudi Arabia, Mozambique
Madagascar, Paris, Greece
The Middle Africa is where we lived
Better known as Queenbridge
 
Nas, Nas you don't s 
Olu Dara in the house, you don't s 
Muddy Waters' Howling Wolf you don't s 
From the Blues to Street Hop you don't s 
Tell 'em Pop 

[Outro: Olu Dara singing / Nas adlibbing]
See I come from Mississippi (Let 'em know)
I was young and runnin' wild (Runnin' wild)
Ended up in New York City (Yeah!)
Where I had my first child (That's me)
I named the boy Nasir (Yeah, Daddy!)
All the boys call him Nas (Luh ya, boy)
I told him as a youngster
He'll be the greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Greatest man alive (You the greatest, Pop)
Gre-Gre-Gre-Gre-Greatest man alive!
Rest In Peace Ray Charles


[Chorus - singing]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright

 
Yeah, Brooks Brothers overcoat, know the ropes, smooth is holdin' those
Briefcases, silk ties, slick as them older folks
Silver fo'-fo', got no,
My chauffer driver just left some of my colleagues smokin' that Cali
Caught a glimpse of myself in the Barney's shop window
Kinda' see my father's features creepin' in a little
Got an office on Broadway, business in Jamaica
Tell my daughter try the hardest so the best schools'll    take her
And I'm late to a dite with my wife, I realize
I s ped to shop, had to get her some type surprise
And I'm walkin' through it, chaos is all around me
But God got me, no fear, through the fire pride s  

[Chorus - singing]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And all this drama's got me feelin' uptight
I don't know what I'll do if I don't see my boo
'Cause she's standin' on the corner of Linden Boulevard
Holding our baby in her baby in her arms
So hold on, your daddy's in sight

 
Yeah, Nine-four, Destiny opens her eyes
For the first time, praise God, baby mom's cryin'
Planned to be a strong black family
But we both were too young, too strung, too much flashin'
New come, I caught verbal assassin runnin' with
Nothin' but the worst type, worst fight
But we brought my baby home the first night
Cursed like sailors, burst out the crib
Ragin' in my new car bought from entertainment
Champaign and gainin' clout fast, whiplash
Did this bitch just pass in the club pugged up, stupid ass
Grabbed her by the pony tail, "never disrespect me"
I'm a street vet, regret the sex, but not Desi
Moved back to your grandma, I'm single, the land's mine
She keeps the Benz, I'm all in the streets again
Squeezin' the pen, released again, chart  pers,
Hard-bottoms blessed the feet, now less baby mom's problems
New woman, she's great, this a different world,
Checkin' out my wife's chemistry with my little girl
It's so amazin' playin', life is so crazy
I've grown up the thankful for lessons God gave me

[Chorus - singing]
There's a war in the streets tonight
And nobody's really feelin' alright
I got a blunt for a chronic, a juice for my tonic
I know now that I'm feelin' right if it goes down
'Cause my third eye sees the lowdown
And I know it's not my time to go now
'Cause God's got my back in this showdown
So I know we'll be alright


[SPEAKING:]
I'd like to dedicate this one here to my star,
To the one I cherish,

One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
[rewind]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do
Check, one, two


Yo I'm hot like 95 Fahrenheit
On a summer night, tight spot where bodies rot
Rats drink from water drops, in the streets niggaz
Little kids scared cops, wit bread dots
Philosophical gangsta, where violent priors
Goin back like black and white TV's wit pliers
Leanin on broke down cars, wit flat tires
Flash iron, or anybody tryin on the blocks I'm supplyin on
Mighty call, my peeps, tie ballons up
And swallow 'em and the penal got goons, lots of 'em
Cops see them and run, don't want no drama
Certain parts of the streets, the beast don't want a part of
Mortar, hood haunted like the Dakota
Where John Lennon was shot up, but he sang for peace
He begged for freedom, hanged wit wild Jamicians
From Kingston, who drink Irish Moss
Listenin to Peter Winston, Machintosh
Lightning hits the   of the church steeple
When I'm writin, semi-automatic no hyphen
It's frightening.... [scratches]


The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
Understandable smooth shit, that murderers move wit


I take summers off, cause I love winter beef
Started '87, wit the shotty in the sheet
Three-quarter length beige, dressed to kill
Bust a shell at the ground, pellets hit the crowd
Nobody like a snitch, everybody shut they mouth
Rule which car heart, gun powder stains
Smellin like trees, set some mill on the brain
Skeemin on ya girls, bamboozled on ya chain
Got ill up on the train, twistin off a cap
Of a English in my vain, might of pushed you on the tracks
Death crack fiends, who can't speak, scream noises
Cause you bought a drummer sooked, from one of my boys, it's
.... Just another day in the hood
And I'm, wit some wild brothers, up to no good
We saw the movies, like Tony Montana, and 'em
But our style was let them piled in, we robbin 'em
Money dudes, make 'em come up out they shoes
Run they jewels, word is bond, where my man Nino goin
And I had to make a song, speakin on my old life
For the thief's who come out at night




One, two
Check, one, two [echoes]
One, two
Check, one, two
One, two, who got more style, the son do [echoes]
[explosion]







"It's yours!" --> [T La Rock]

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?

I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi til I'm charged
Then writin in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin
To hold the mic I'm throbbin, mechanical movement
Understandable smooth shit that murderers move wit
The thief's theme, play me at night, they won't act right
The fiend of hip-hop has got me stuck like a crack pipe
The mind activation, react like I'm facin time like
'Pappy' Mason with pens I'm embracin
Wipe the sweat off my dome, spit the phlegm on the streets
Suede Timb's on my feets, makes my cypher, complete
Whether crusin in a six-cab, or Montero Jeep
I can't call it, the beats make me fallin asleep
I keep fallin, but never fallin six feet deep
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for presidents to represent me (Say what?)
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?

To my man Ill Will, God bless your life
"It's yours!"
To my peoples throughout Queens, God bless your life
I trip we box up crazy bitches aimin guns in all my baby pictures
Beef with housin police, release scriptures that's maybe Hitler's
Yet I'm the mild, money gettin style, rollin foul
The versatile, honey stickin wild, golden child
Dwellin in the Rotten Apple, you get tackled
Or caught by the devil's lasso, shit is a hassle
There's no days, for broke days, we sell it, smoke pays
While all the old folks pray, to Je-sus' soakin they sins in trays
of holy water, odds against Nas are slaughter
Thinkin a word best describin my life, to name my daughter
My strength, my son, the star, will be my resurrection
Born in correction all the wrong shit I did, he'll lead a right direction
How ya livin large, a broker charge, cards are mediocre
You flippin coke or playin spit spades in strip poker

"It's yours!"

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
  Yo, the   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
[PR] Break it down

[Pete Rock cuts and scratches "It's yours!"]

I'm the young city bandit, hold myself down singlehanded
For murder raps, I kick my thoughts alone, get remanded
Born alone, die alone, no crew to keep my crown or throne
I'm deep by sound alone, caved inside in a thousand miles from home
I need a new nigga, for this black cloud to follow
Cause while it's over me it's too dark to see tomorrow
Trying to maintain, I flip, fill the clip to the tip
Picturin my peeps, now the income make my heartbeat skip
And I'm amped up, they locked the champ up, even my brain's in handcuffs
Headed for Indiana stabbin women like the Phantom
The crew is lampin big Willie style
Check the chip toothed smile, plus I profile wild
Stash through the flock wools, burnin dollars to light my stove
Walk the blocks wit a bop, checkin Danes plus the games
people play, bust the problems of the world today

"It's yours!"

[Chorus: Nas, Pete Rock]

[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
[PR] Whose world is this?
  The   is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
   ... the world is yours, the world is yours
[PR] It's mine, it's mine, it's mine
Whose world is this?
"It's yours!"
Break it down

Yea aight?
To everybody in Queens, the foundation
"It's yours!"
The world is yours
To everybody uptown, yo, the world is yours
"It's yours!"
The world is yours
To everybody in Brooklyn
Y'all know the world is yours	
"It's yours!"
The world is yours
Everbody in Mount Vernon, the world is yours
"It's yours!"
Long Island, the world is yours	
"It's yours!"
Staten Island, yea the world is yours
"It's yours!"
South Bronx, the world is yours
"It's yours!"
Aight

[Pete Rock keeps cuttin and scratchin "It's yours!" to fade]








Take it to the bridge
To the motherf*ckin' bridge
Queensbridge in the motherf*cker

It ain't hard to tell
[x3]


The buddha monk's in your trunk, turn the bass up
Not stories by Aesop, place your loot up, parties I shoot up
Nas, I analyze, drop a jew-el, inhale from the L
School a fool well
You feel it like braille ain't hard to tell
I kick a skill like Shaquille holds a pill
Vocabulary spills I'm Ill
Plus Matic I freak a beat
Slam it like Iron Shiek
Jam like a tech with correct techniques
So analyze me, surprise me, but can't magmatize me
Scannin' while you're plannin' ways to sabotage me
I leave'em froze like her-on in your nose
Nas could rock well
It ain't hard to tell

It Ain't hard to tell
[x3]


What's a beat if the rap don't click
I spit rhymes like I'm sick, dying loss in a pit
The only way I can escape is by vocals
Verbalize a strife
Stabbin' ears like a knife hood like
The Prophet of the gutter
Lyrics are silk mega butter
I flow never stutter
Clever poetic brothers on a mission
Dissin' all who perps the fraud
Scrams listen, (and) do what the experts record
Burn your pen and pads, mics you'll need not
Well I be packin' like a rasta in a weed spot
Hittin' your hearts like a hollow tip
Verbally illin' minds manipulated
My raps a nickel-plated
I illustrate it, X-rated, then move out
Nas the parlayer takes you on a new route
It's suicide poetry released from a cell
With immense clientele, I excel
It ain't hard to tell


It ain't hard to tell
[x3]


Now, I'm blessed with the finesse to express like Shakespeare
The blocks "Cape Fear" drop metaphors when the breaks clears
My mic check is life or death, breathin' a sniper's breath
I exhale the yellow smoke of buddha through righteous steps
Deep like "The Shining", sparkle like a diamond
Sneak a Uzi on the island in my army jacket linin'
Hit the Earth like a comet, invasion
Nas is like the Afrocentric Asian, half-man, half-amazin
And in my physical, I'll express through song
Delete stress like Moltrin, extend strong
Drink Moet with Medusa, give her shotguns inhale
From the spliff that I lifted in Hell
It ain't hard to tell

It ain't hard to tell
[x3]






Yeah yeah.
On the.. On the.. On the.
On the real, all you crab niggaz know the deal

Finally up in this nigga
Let's pay homage to Illmatic
Let's put the crown where it's at
10 years
Never been done this real by nobody

To my seed, May I lead you into no greed or evil
In the categories of stories I breed my sequel
You know the money, blues, blunts, broken 22's
Monkey see, Monkey do
Shorty sipping sunny dew
Now it's V.S.O.P. in a Phantom, mad smoky
Murder trees, cruisin gat in the stash so it won't poke me
Up in the Trump Plaza, Suite 3010, don't make no noise cause we dirty
Tell them hoes hurry in
We got the room lit up with perfume, and mad boom
And there's video taping bloomin ass's on the zoomin lens
Rollin on you nondescript niggaz
You're marked for death like Colombians with bad coke that gyp niggaz
Tilt the dutch, twisted up the uwee if you're skilled enough
In Will we trust, salute the dead the nine mili busts

That verse is 10 years old, 9Â½ years old
Street's Disciple
The Rebirth comin at you this year baby
It's on baby

Yeah
To the hood, may this be the day that we pop them bottles
This is mandatory, what if there's not tomorrow?
You know the murder rate, jealousy, you heard 'em say
He say, she say, I'm bout cheddar, he don't deserve to make
Sippin clear liquor with niggaz, that talk sideways
Listenin close, to every word in case they violate
Up in the projects Apartment 5D
Spark a lea' it's bout da reed, countin everything the block see
We bout to need to take the corners from them cowards
Get it on so y'all can move more coke powder, by the hour
Hold in case we gotta rip niggaz
Loaded - Teflon coated projectiles'll flip niggaz
From ninth grade to lightweight to grams to my mans with guns in hand
Police vans, they missed the summers again

Yeah, power to the people
Death to the phonies
This beast to the mic 1 2 check
Y'all fed-e-rallies on me
And they look like you
Approachin me like "How you, Homie?"
The F.B.I. see only one problem, they try to slump me
After the young black male cuz he makes a lot of money
So hustlers make crack sales cuz they deprived and hungry
My country hates that I could run free state to state with hunnies
While makin cake with real golded plate rims on Hum-V's
The bush stroker, the kush smoker, nigga
Just when you thought it was over look over your shoulders
I'm 30 now, baby sip drinks and sip 'em slow
Motto no stress, smokin less than I did befo'
You see the kid was broke till I spitted vivid expressions of hard livin
Ghetto children, of a lesser god, religion was fast women, expensive cars
Y'all witnessin over 10 years - THE BEST OF NAS



Yeah, yeah, yo, yeah, yeah


For niggaz up in they mom's crib listenin
To this unadulterated Nas shit wishin it was then
Instead a, me on this track on this beach with palm trees
Drinks with umbrellas straws telling it raw
Jungle of concrete killers and snakes I was amongst that
Bundles of crack through this funnel that's black
I want you to vision through my telescope see the hell I wrote
It's Reynolds when I Wrap it like a envelope package
And they would send the dope back then
Numbers, pimpin and robbin, well they still robbin and pimpin
But it's small change compare to hip hoppin
And did I mention millions because of lip poppin
Trips expensive gift shoppin whip drivin
Benzes, Jeeps, see, them and they bitch got one
It's shockin you thinkin naw it's just rhymin
But all this time it's like organized crimin
For instance, there was a time when there was a line
Between streets and business, but now peep how it's mixed in
The beef is now sickenin, everybody got paper
Words of power, because of it the cops hate ya
The government watchin all of those who thuggin it
They wanna lock us up cause they kids are lovin it
Not knowin that most rappers are straight ass
The shots ring out, whenever we clash it's Star Wars


We call it Star Wars
What happens when the shots ring out, Star Wars
We call it Star Wars


Caviar never, I rather the Cajun blacken
Catfish no snails simple nigga to please
Met a bad bitch dimples in her cheeks
She remembers Busy B battles when it was peace
Caught myself driftin in thought, cause now it's different I thought
Niggaz was raised off the shit I record
Like I was brought up off that Planet Rock
Kurtis Blow, James Todd Smith, Shannon Scott, LaRock in the jams
Why would they f*ck with a don, Jehovah witness
Him and his co-defendants, I eat 'em like Lucky Charms
With two percent low fat milk, five percent pro black built
It's nothin mother had a motherf*cker
I don't think about it niggaz talkin there's a lot of gossip
That I'm a prophet or I can't go back to my projects
Can I? Does a plant grow from a plant yes
Do trees grow from a forest MC's y'all are clitoris
Y'all niggaz roll with any click that's winnin any crew
Doin whatever's trendy, even they leave me too
Ain't enough room in this town
What is beef between ghetto word spitters with crowns, Star Wars


Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out everywhere, Star Wars
Cause this is Star Wars, shots ring out


This ain't, no Oscars or MTV or Joan Rivers fashion police
Not what you read in tabloid seats
These are MC's that live by the code, it's hard for me to spit it
Because the game was supposed to be sold we livid
Came from the streets we the voice of the youth
America's nightmare was given a the mic booth
Nike boots, leathers and jean, jewelry, cribs and cars
Rappers not dependin on your nine to five jobs
Entertainment, this is our world this is our language
Different regions speakin east and west gang shit
You got your positive shit like, Common Sense
But even he had drama with the Don Mega Cube
Acknowledge the words get twisted at times it's rules
What you think is different from the block whenever we feud
F*ck your pictures and your plaques your tours and autographs
Don't trust bitches and niggaz who tell you your all of that
Cause, they'll be in your enemies face, sayin it's safe
To run in your release party sprayin the place
Or catch you when you least on point, putting your keys in the door
Behind you with your seeds in Kay Bee Toys store
Maybe the words get disrespectful now your niggaz check you
You 'gon let that nigga play you, you know we 'gon rep you
Next mornin every news channel and front page
Headlines another rapper was slayed, this is Star Wars




"Get-get.. get down!" - [James Brown]

 
Uh.. uh.. uh..
New York streets where killers'll walk like Pistol Pete
And Pappy Mason, gave the young boys admiration
Prince from Queens and Fritz from Harlem
Street legends, the drugs kept the hood from starvin
Pushin cars, Nicky Barnes was the 70's
But there's a long list of high-profile celebrities
Worldwide on the thorough side of things
Livest kings, some died, one guy, one time
one day grabs me, as I'm about to blast heat
40-side of Vernon, I turned well he asked me
"Whatchu up to, the cops gon' bust you"
I was a teen drunk off brew, stumbled I wondered
if God sent him, cause two squad cars entered the block
and looked at us, I ain't flinch when they watched
I took it upstairs, the bathroom mirror, brushed my hair
Starin at a young disciple, I almost gave my life to what the dice do
Yeah man, throwin them bones
Hopin my ace get his case thrown
His girl ain't wait for him, she in the world straight hoein
While he lookin at centerfolds of pretty girls
showin they little cooch, gangstas don't die he's livin proof
The D.A. who tried him was lyin
A white dude, killed his mother durin the case
Hung jury, now the D.A. is bein replaced
Pre-trial hearin is over, it's real for the soldier
Walks in the courtroom, the look in his eyes is wild
Triple-homicide, I sit in the back aisle
I wanna crack a smile when I see him
Throw up a fist for black power, cause all we want is his freedom
He grabbed a court officer's gun and started squeezin
Then he grabbed the judge, screams out -- nobody leavin everybody

Some niggaz f*ck they enemies in they ass when they catch 'em
Weird-ass niggaz are dangerous, so don't test 'em
They make you, dissapear, this a year that I won't forget
Sold CD's double platinum, met mo' execs
Southern niggaz, independent label, real killers
Know the business, ran Tennessee for years, now they chillin
They had the coke game somethin crazy
Sold music out the trunk of they car, that shit amazed me
Put me onto heron blunts, sherm or somethin
Took a puff, what the f*ck, I turned to punch them
Southern niggaz ain't slow, nigga tried to play me
I left from around them dudes, they cool but they crazy
Now I'm back around the old school that raised me
New York gangstas, we loungin, out in L.A. see
A dude wrote my dawg from Pelican Bay
The letter say, "Nas I got your back - the fools don't play"
I rolled with some Crips down to a Crenshaw funeral
Never saw so many men slaughtered and I knew the ho responsible
The nigga still alive in a hospital
Midnight they crept in his room and shot the doctor too
See my cousin's in the game, thuggin and things
He plugged me with a dame who was half-Mexicano
Gave the ass up, I'ma mack daddy Soprano
She passed me the indigo, but the imbecile
shoulda never tippy-toed, thought my eyes were closed
Openin the hotel room do', to let her goons in
But I moved in a manner, on some Jet Li shit
I let the hammers blow, wet three kids
See honey thought I had somethin to do, with all the drama
Cause I was with a crew, that had her people killed
Called up my cousin, told him I ain't f*ckin witchu
He responded cool, but told me out here this how motherf*ckers

[sample cut and repeated]

[unknown speaker]
All I really gotta say is that
if that's how our people gon' get down, how we ever gon' get up?
How we ever gon' get up if that's how we get down?
A shame when you ain't look at it
My folk is yo' folk, but we all kinfolk
Somebody gotta make a change



[Chorus 2X: Nas]
I carry the cross, if Virgin Mary had an abortion
I'd still be carried in the chariot by stampeding horses
Had to bring it back to New York
I'm happy that the streets is back in New York
For you rappers, I carry the cross

 
Y'all can keep y'all weak beats, from your corny producers
There's a new king of the streets, you're gonna get used to
I was the old king of the streets, that y'all once hated
But now I reinvented myself, and y'all all waited
NAS, N.A.S. mean Niggaz Against Society
Noisy I aim not silently, noose all surroundin me
I hang 'em I string 'em up ain't no thing I just drop 'em
to which doctor you copped and you locked and it ain't what it was
I changed it up from that pop shit it's hard to see R&B
rappers arguably, started f*ckin up the game horribly
Cause, I parted the sea, then these novices targetted me
Bitches infatuated say they love me lyin to me
What I've discovered is my brother's tryin to be
the next me, yeah I support him but he's blinded I see
jealousy he love me to death am I buggin I love him for life
We both still mournin on our mother's, life
And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to f*ck
A six, a truck, some guns to bust
I wish it was that simple, the last emperor, hit yo' ass
with the Nasty Nas, diary, get out my path



 
I can't keep a bitch cause none of them come up for a little less
I can't be too rich, too many hoes, lined up for sex
I can't rest until my niggaz in houses with pretty maids
Water and flowers in 'em
While my niggaz walk around in they trousers grinnin
Gotta keep a lot of heat; 30 cals 10 millimeters
40 cals plus the heckler, to set y'all straight
You too light? I shoot your freckles out
You too dark? The infrared show you what the tec about
Huh?    I'm stressin out, need more offices for bosses
Secretaries and meetings with big sharks, who mad greedy
We can sell mo', boats on the coast
Give, coats to the po' and give, hope to the broke then live low
But that ain't reality, I look happy but under the sky
You see a nigga who know, out of three women 2 out of 3
will love you but lead you to they own, hidden evil
BITCH!    You the reason niggaz be beefin, hoe get on
'Posed to be Earth, ain't worth the pussy that you sit on
From here on, it's a new day
Million dollars ain't, what it was yesterday
Many problems, many niggaz, most involved but they fake
Hope y'all relate



  I   the cross




[shotgun blast]
[old school break beat, thugs chant "Bravehearts!" 7X]

    
Uh, uh, uh, now let's get it all in perspective
For all y'all enjoyment, a song y'all can step wit'
Y'all appointed me to bring rap justice
But I ain't five-O, y'all know it's Nas yo
Grey goose and a whole lotta hydro
Only describe us as soldier survivors
Stay laced in the best, well dressed with finesse
In a white tee lookin for wifie
Thug girl who fly and talks so nicely
Put her in the coupe so she can feel the nice breeze
We can drive thru the city no doubt, but don't say my car's  less
Say the titties is out, newness here's the anthem
Put your hand up that you shoot with, count your loot wit'
Push the pool stick in your new crib, same hand that you hoop with
Swing around like you stu-pid, king'a the town, yeah I been that
You know I click-clack where you and yor men's at
Do the Smurf, do the Wop, Baseball Bat
Roof  like we bringing '88 back

[Chorus: Nas]
They shootin'! -- Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' Big/"big" money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas? Where them dimes at?

They shootin'! -- Aw made you look
You a slave to a page in my rhyme book
Gettin' Big/"big" money, playboy your time's up
Where them gangstas at? Where them dimes at?

    
This ain't rappin, this is Street-Hop
Now get up off your ass like your seat's hot
My live niggaz lit up the reefer
Trunk'a the car we got the streetsweeper
Don't start none, won't be none
No reason for your mans to panic
You don't wanna see no ambulances
Knock a pimp's drink down in his pimp cup
That's the way you get Timberland'd up
Let the music diffuse all the tension
Ball or convention, free admission
Hustlers, dealers and killers'ca move swift
Girls get close, you'ca feel where the tool's kept
All my just-comin' homies, parolees
Get money, leave the beef alone slowly
Get out my face, you people so phoney
Pull out my waist, the eagle fo-forty


[thugs chanting "Bravehearts!" 4X over DJ scratching gunshots]

    
I see niggaz runnin', yo my mood is real rude
I lay you out, show you what steel do
Mobsters don't box, my pump shot obliges
Every invitation to fight you punk hazas
Like Pun said, "You ain't even en mi clasa"
Maybach Benz, back seat, tv plasma
Ladies lookin for athletes or rappers
Whatever you choose, whatever you do
Make sure he a thug and intelligent too
Like a real thoroughbred is, show me love
Lemme feel how the head is
Females whose the sexiest is always the nastiest
[record scratched off, Nas rhymes acapella]
And I like a little sassiness, a lotta class
Mommy reach in your bag, pass the fifth
I'm a leader, at last this a don you wit'
My nines'll spit, niggaz loose consciousness




Uh, uh, uh, uh

[Chorus 2X]
Lord have mercy, Jesus Christ
He's just nice, he just slice like a ginsu
Look at the life that I been through
I'm the last real nigga alive, that's official

 
Y'all don't know about my Biggie wars
Who you thought 'Kick In The Door' was for?
But that's my heart, y'all still trippin of this Jigga shit
Real niggas listen up and I'mma tell you how the whole thing start
Off   I brung Queens up from hard times
Rockin at the Fever, streets was all mine
It was my version of the blues, droppin our schools
The crack epidemic had rap representin new rules
So I, got in em shoes, tried em wore them
Wasn't a perfect fit, so I couldn't sport em
Young murderers ride, I knew all them
Jungle got shot, Will died, we was warring
I wrote it in my album
I was 18 when Lake seen the Island
And Lord held me down and
My surroundings started changing
I had a baby, I was making my rounds with AZ
Niggas started noticing my flow and was open when
The Golden Child closed em in with more style than them older men
Puff tried to start a label, Prince Rakeem had formed Wu-Tang
Snoop and Dre had a new thang
So Puff drove his new Range through Queensbridge Projects
He let me drive it, before Ready to Die hit
BIG and I hit blunts performing at the Arc
Next thing you knew, BIG blew and all the balling starts
He had Kim and his crew, I found Fox, only niggas in New York with number 
one charts
BIG was ahead of his time, him and Raekwon my niggas
But dig it, they couldn't get along
That's when Ghostface said it on the Purple tape
Bad Boy biting Nas album cover way(?)
BIG told me Rae was stealing my slang
And Rae told me out in Shaolin BIG would do the same thing
But I borrowed from both them niggas
Jigga started to flow like us, but hit with 'Ain't No Niggas'
Had much Versace swagger
BIG admired the Brooklyn knight and it took him in as Iceberg the rapper
Today don't know nothing, about this bullshit
There's more shit than wanting to be this King of New York shit

[Chorus 2x]

 
Rap became a version of Malcom and Martin
Rest In Peace Will, Queensbridge live on
There's some ghetto secrets I can't rhyme in this song
There's some missing pieces I had to leave out
I had lot trust for Steve Stoute
At some point till I got to know him
We old friends, but what's loyal?
Puff soaked Interscope offices
With champagne bottles on Steve, and Steve thought the drama is on me
Cause previously it would have been, against whoever
Friends forever
However, I learn, with some niggas it's all business
But I'm a street dude with morals
To diss niggas with Jigga too much, he used to say Jay wanted my spot
I laughed, stayed home, never hung a lot
A quiet man who used to be alone planning
Baby moms thought I was too quiet, couldn't stand it
She hit the streets, later on she hittin the sheets
With a rapper who wanted me on his songs, thinking he strong
I taught her how to watch for cars that might follow
Tauht her street shit that I know
Her weakness was shine yo
But that's her, I ain't mad baby, it made me stronger
Now I get my paper longer
Illmatic I was boss
It Was Written I flossed
One of the most creative LPs ever to hit stores
In the Firm I learned I am Nastradamus
QB's Finest, Oochie Wally, faced more problems
I gave it all up so I can chill at home with mama
She was getting old and sick so I stayed beside her
We had the best times, she asked would I make more songs
I told her not till I see her health get more strong
In the middle of that, Jay tried to sneak attack
Assasinate my character, degrade my hood
Cause in order for him to be the Don, Nas had to go
The Gam-B-I-N-O rules I understood
What you want, see, I already had
The Gift and The Curse? F*ck that shit, the first shall be last
I'm the man's man, a rapper's rapper
G-O-D S-O-N, they'll be none after
I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo
It hurt me when I had to kill him and his whole squad for dolo [for dolo echoes]


Uh, Uh, Uh

[Chorus 2X]
















Braveheart for life

[sample - repeated 8x "Z-z-z-zone Out"]

So y'all wit me? Yea, What, Yea
Why don't y'all blast on these niggas, man

Tuck in your chain put your watch in your pocket
Here come the Braveheart straight out the projects
We live the life where the blood spills
Same thing that get you cats nigga, get you killed
Warnin', Jungle always keep a gun on him
Pull out, {*shooting sound*}, four head gone 'n
Sloppy, droppin' you birds
Close range so my bullets don't swerve, curve
No bullshit
Back in ya hand, find me
Call Earl, death is the ways of the world
Y'all made criminals
Tryin' to wild out there so crack, bust guns at Bow Wow's age
Fightin' in jail, lookin' for heaven, livin' in hell
F*ckin 'em hos, born to cope since I was 12
Way too foul walk around all the time
With a gray Mack 10 and a pocket full o' dimes

Braveheart to the graveyard, let's go niggas
Scared straight, but F*CK them hos
Keep it, dead serious
Believe it don't believe us, until you see me creepin',
Now you sleep with them fishes
G-W-I-Z, so delicious
To all them ghetto and sober bitches in 'burban districts
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son
And this is the military turn it up
My moves erase a ton, your son less thump nah
Heat talk feet walk you run uh
Rat ta-tat, Hear them shots come
Drop son, pull out
You better send 'em back son, or feel that casket
The peeps be like one (one)
I'm movin on passin' chumps, and very thoroughly promoted by God's Son

G-O-D S-O-N I S-O-O-T-H-E a female's estrogen
With my testosterone, male hormone
Enough for a giant's body, science S-C-I-E-N-C-E
Don't tempt me, EMS against you, me I'm just, invincible
Like Mike Jack said, for me and Al Sharpton won't be Broke in Harlem
That's that, who made this style, solo or X
Are you TFO's doctor or Mobb Deep
Whoever, I freaked it yes, so meet ya death
I never wear Esco, I got a New Line comin' like cinemas
Remember the, original, y'all still tryina show niggas are rich
Town house niggas
I'm six cribs deep, six bank accounts in six countries
Na I'm lyin', who gives a f*ck that's so tired
While pictures of Bravehearts just livin' it up
A million of us, each nigga inchin' a bus
You got a house in Virginia
The only way you sicker than us
Gettin' bagged with .22's now you's a ridiculous f*ck
No need for the gun play, it's ok, 'cause you dyin' anyway

Yo, this is for them Heismann drop outs
Niggas who copped out
If you prefer shots over knockouts
Sniffin' coke, smokin' weed
Sellin' crack, sellin' smack
You thuggin' it, you ain't turn it back
Braveheart's gettin' money ruthless 'till the world end
Gettin' high with my enemy's girlfriend
I used to have a bike on a bench
Now I got a jeep on this trip
Coke in the pot, heat on my head

Nigga dont s  blazin' cuz ya target's movin'
Shoot 'till the gun's empty stupid, Queens
Niggas so ruthless, really excuses is
Useless to these swift executioners
And thats Queensbridge nigga, all day
Pump packs o' crack, smoke purple haze
Runnin from D's quickly knockout rookies
G Wiz you know what I'm all about
To all my real niggas



The phone rings
Another peaceful moment is lost
Latifah's chest jingle in "Set It Off"
I press pause in the bed as a king
I let it ring 4 or 5 times
Answer while I'm puffin' my green
It's Tamika sayin', "Hi Nas"
I caught a flashback of her askin' me was I asthmatic 'fore I tapped that
She offered me dinner under the moon
I said, "Sorry. I made plans at Ray's Boom-Boom Room"
Nine push-ups... Strength's gone at the tenth one so why hook up
The pimp's gone off the Platron Tequila
Put on my Lee's and the original Fila's
Sedated from L's, 380 cocked, naked ladies laid up in tails
Like Whodini I chose, gazelles don't lean on my nose
Drivin' by the clubs gleamin' and go
Heads turn it's a freak show
I need them to know... When will they learn 
Nas need a queen not a hoe to... 
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me but won't f*ck with my enemies
And you can sing along 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy

[CHORUS (Claudette Ortiz)]
Hey Nas... How ya doin'? 
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be groovin'
But let's take... it... slow


One for the honeys who roll blunts up but don't smoke
Two for the few who see potential in you when you broke
Three for the G they got, they game is hot I give it to you
Double life wife- play with the man that's livin' with you
Here's the issue... A woman gotta be stunnin'
Get to a man's heart through his stomach
You gotta be skilled in the culinary arts
Know a brother stay mad hungry when he spark
Hit the museum, maybe Central Park, you mentally smart
Picture we in Tiffany, you becomin' my counterpart
If I want Chinese then you buy me a wok
If you want barbeque I call Professor and Ock
'Cuz u... point out my enemies, someone who's into me
But not a hyper chick- someone with the proper energy
A girl that's into me who won't f*ck all my enemies
And you could be the one 'cuz I'm lovin' ya energy

[CHORUS (Kelis)]
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'
But let's take... it... slow


Slow is the way
Holdin' hands, tongue and hickeys
Hope and I pray where I run at you run away with me
That's if my gun get busy we gotta get outta there
Hear sirens jump in the stick drop a Sedan and hide for years
Like noone else in the world did this except for us two
You gotta trust me, I gotta trust you
If coppers bust me it's me you rescue, this to the death boo
You rep me respectfully that's how I rep for you
Retired from pimpin', perspire is drenchin'
As we... suck and f*ck each other's minds out commission
Time's out forbidden
Until we pass out, that's when we s 
We give it all we got, give it all we got- we hot
Give it all we got, give it all we got- we rock
Give it all we got, give it all we got
You 'bout the baddest thing
Since Michael had Billy Jean
And Prince gave you diamond's and pearls
But to be my queen you must... 
Point out my enemies, a girl who's into me
But not a hype chick- someone with proper energy
Someone who's into me who won't f*ck all my enemies
And you can be the one 'cuz I'm feelin' ya energy

[CHORUS (Claudette & Kelis)]
Hey Nas... How ya doin'?
Take my name... And my number
Meanwhile... We'll be cruisin'
But let's take... it... slow

[Claudette (2x)]
I can be... What you said
That you need... I can be...All that
I can be... I can have your back... baby



[Kids]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

 
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen up 
You can be anything in the world, in God we trust
An architect, doctor, maybe an actress 
But nothing comes easy it takes much practice
Like, I met a woman who's becoming a star
She was very beautiful, leaving people in awe
Singing songs, Lina Horn, but the younger version
Hung with the wrong person
Got her strung on that
Heroin, cocaine, sniffin up drugs all in her nose...
Coulda died, so young, now looks ugly and old
No fun cause now when she reaches for hugs people hold they breath
Cause she smells of corrosion and death 
Watch the company you keep and the crowd you bring
Cause they came to do drugs and you came to sing
So if you gonna be the best, I'ma tell you how,
Put your hands in the air, and take a vow

[Chorus - 2x (Nas and Kids)]
I know I can (I know I can) 
Be what I wanna be (be what I wanna be) 
If I work hard at it (If I work hard at it)
I'll be where I wanna be (I'll be where I wanna be)

 
Be, B-Boys and girls, listen again
This is for grown looking girls who's only ten
The ones who watch videos and do what they see
As cute as can be, up in the club with fake ID
Careful, 'fore you meet a man with HIV
You can host the TV like Oprah Winfrey 
Whatever you decide, be careful, some men be
Rapists, so act your age, don't pretend to be 
Older than you are, give yourself time to grow
You thinking he can give you wealth, but so
Young boys, you can use a lot of help, you know
You thinkin life's all about smokin weed and ice
You don't wanna be my age and can't read and write
Begging different women for a place to sleep at night
Smart boys turn to men and do whatever they wish
If you believe you can achieve, then say it like this



 
Be, be, 'fore we came to this country 
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys
There was empires in Africa called Kush 
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans
Asian Arabs and gave them gold when 
Gold was converted to money it all changed 
Money then became empowerment for Europeans
The Persian military invaded 
They heard about the gold, the teachings, and everything sacred
Africa was almost robbed naked
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships 
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went 
He was so shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically 
Still goes on today, you see? 
If the truth is told, the youth can grow 
Then learn to survive until they gain control
Nobody says you have to be gangstas, hoes
Read more learn more, change the globe
Ghetto children, do your thing
Hold your head up, little man, you're a king
Young Princess when you get your wedding ring
Your man is saying "She's my queen"



Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music y'all, save the music y'all
Save the music





Alchemist you know me man
I'm the type of nigga that write rhymes right on the spot in the studio
soon as I hear the track; you know what I'm sayin?
Word but I wanted to bring a couple of books to the studio today
Man I foundthese shits up in the crib man in boxes man
I don't even remember when I was writing these shits
or what's in these shits man probably a bunch of bullshit man
F*ck it check it

How can I trust you when I can't trust me?
Picture myself a old man a O.G.
Some niggas will conversate with liers all day
Time pass...(Nah lemme start somethin' else)
Soul on ice death threats given by clowns
I guess livin' is prison when you live around clowns
I'm hexed cursed worse I been blessed first
I thought I was abnormal cause I would overcome any tasked called to
So there it is I'ma prince I'ma get slain
Some do minor shit swear they on the   of they game
Ya rhymin' is called "Vagina Monologue"
It kinda supports theories of scary niggas who should lie in the morgue
Rarely y'all come in contact with the real
Since Pun passed he was the last shine of sun I could feel
Yo said there's a few left since music's expressions of life
Damn I wish I took more time to write in my book of rhymes

Oh shit Tina - I been lookin' for this bitch number damn.
No this rhyme is weak..
This is week I remember this bullshit right here
(My Book of Rhymes)
Gandhi was a... what the fu..?

Gandhi was a fool, nigga fight to the death
The US Army is a school that teach ya plights of conquest
(I wonder when I wrote this. Nah it's weak)
The money's ya religion sky the limit live life
Numbers is big business makes the poor live trife
The glimmers of hope provoke those without dollars to dream
Through your existence become wealthy knowledge is king
Pimps and card sharks thiefs murderers with hard luck
Addicts and fiends prostitutes passin' for teens is my society
Cops that shoot blacks is routine for noteriety
Grow up watchin' well dressed niggas with charms
Beautiful ladies on their arms
Dangerous new cars was my fantasy for Nas
Rubbin my lips with Campophenique
Still behind the ears wet turned out to be
Pioneers vets amongst hustlers crack sellers and liers and squares...
(Nah that was weak there)
My people be projects or jail never Harvard or Yale
Pardon me type in my 2way while I'm chargin' my cell
It's hard to be iced up with Gucci god poverty's real
I can't fight you cause you would sue me niggas be groupies
I see imitators tryin' to make albums spittin' my style
And they don't even realize that I notice they stealing Nas' shit
I pump some Rick James with that Teena Marie
My nina lean on me like Swoop it's crap this can't be
My book of rhymes

This can't be my book of rhymes writing this bullshit!
(My Book of Rhymes)
Nah neva that f*ck that, aw why you laughin' Alchemist?
Huh you a funny nigga... naw yeah
(My Book of Rhymes)
I'm tellin' you I'ma come up with some new shit now
F*ck that I'ma write again now f*ck that
I musta been high on some shit mmm what the f*ck is this?

Look how we treat pregnancy women in the 'hood
Our values so low our values are no good
Things our mothers told us we shoulda heeded
Cause now we need it
We older almost able t...
I'm jealous of you how come you so beautiful?
Smelling fresh youthful intelligent while I'm stressin' and shit
Aiyo I envy you 'cause all you do is smile and things come your way
Such a innocent child is what some say
I get upset 'cause I just want to be treated the way you are
Like a star not a worry in this world thus far
But wait a minute we both need ya mother's attention
I must be crazy jealous of my own baby infant
(Kinda crazy)




[Intro: Nas]
I want you to close your eyes
And vision the most beautiful place in the world
If you in the hood on the ghetto street corner
Come on this journey
The best journey
Acres of land and swimming pools and all that
Check it out

[Verson One: Nas]
I'm capable of anything, my imagination can give me wings
To fly like doves over the streets watchin' many things
Kids walkin' home from school on drug block missionaries
Pass out papers that read: Love God
See faces, cases, judges, juries, masons, lawyers and cops
I watch because every thugs face is my mirror
But this was one in particular 
This kid he was the vintage stick em up pro
16 years old, did his jail sentence, nowhere to go
Every mornin calls his comrad to come and get him to smoke
He insane, already gone mad
Blames himself for his setbacks
Dangerous street corners where his sets at
Slang from dust to dawn, detectives act like they maniacs
Chasin' him, his ass was flarin'
Smokin' like a chimney, on really, of course he not carin'
He need a place to go to keep his mind expandin'
I give him a helpin' hand, bring him out to Thugz Mansion

[Chorus: J. Phoenix]
Every corner, every city
There's a place where life's a little easy
Little Hennessy, laid back and cool
Every hour, cause it's all good
Leave all the stress from the world outside
Every wrong done will be alright 
Nothin but peace, love 
And street passion, every ghetto needs a thug mansion

[Verse Two: 2Pac]
Dear momma don't cry, your baby boy's doin good
Tell the homies I'm in heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drippin peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson, and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday
Sang sittin there kickin it with Malcolm, 'til the day came
Little LaTasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand only God can save us
When Miles Davis cuttin lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
that passed on, they in heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin
Remember this face, save me a place, in thug's mansion



[Verse Three: Nas]
A place where death doesn't reside, just thugs who collide
Not to start beef but spark trees, no cops rollin by
No policemen, no homicide, no chalk on the streets
No reason, for nobody's momma to cry
See I'm a good guy, I'm tryin to stick around for my daughter
But if I should die, I know all of my albums support her
This whole year's been crazy, asked the Holy Spirit to save me
Only difference from me and Ossie Davis, gray hair maybe
Cause I feel like my eyes saw too much sufferin
I'm just twenty-some-odd years, I done lost my mother
And I cried tears of joy, I know she smiles on her boy
I dream of you more, my love goes to Afeni Shakur
Cause like Ann Jones, she raised a ghetto king in a war
And just for that alone she shouldn't feel no pain no more
Cause one day we'll all be together, sippin heavnly champagne
What angels saw, with golden wings in thug's mansion





Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh...


A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book
A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse]
Velvet bowties, bulletproofs in the tux, when I roll by
In car similar to a suanas, in my diamonds
And my principal is to study drama
Look what happened in Manhattan
A couple of years ago when guns started clappin'
Two of my dogs fell, two of my niggaz ran
They was amatures in beef with a grown man
It taught me the lessons of how the strong stand
And how the weak, end up in a coffin
Play it cool, that's the old school rule, man
Keep your ears to the street, y'all never lose man
Make your enemies believe there's love there
Cause in war, belief is all fair
Rock them to sleep, shots in your jeep
And you ain't never know the plot was from me
It's from my Masterminds


A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered

A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse]
It ain't a game it's the life
Think it's a game, you layin'
And I'm nice on that black stone merlo
Toast to my hero Nat Turner
Whether below zero, gave the keys to Kelis
Whispered in her earlobe, drive on
Cause she the wife and they the freaks
The underneath my girl caliber
They smiled at her and said "Goodbye" 
With niggaz who thug or die, they wild as us
My bodyguards are my Denially trucks
Knownin' that I'm surrounded by OGs that I don't really get down with
They got a seperate table for their freaks bought them drinks
So we could talk man-to-man so real niggaz could link
I knew, they kill hos too like Ray Carutth
They used to spray troops, now they managing groups
The main nigga sunny had big money since '82
Had two of my dogs whacked, nothing I could do
That was back when I had no crew, I switch that
Now I'm strong with niggaz who felt Sunny was wrong
My money's long his money is weak, he's losing sleep
Trying to feel me out, to see what it's gonna be
But I'm a Mastermind        


A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered
A Mastermind - Sleeps at night, real easy
A Mastermind - Cause everything he does is by the book
A Mastermind - Never do a thing irrational, lives forever, these tales are classical

[Verse]
I live a clean life, I don't even steal cable
I speak for myslef, my niggaz will slay you
Lucky us, this rap done worked out fine
FEDs, check me out, it's no dirt y'all find
This King Of New York shit only last 15 minutes
Every nigga get burned, but it's what you did with it
Niggas who brillant, came in and killed it
Made millions ever three months, new jury
I'm low, smoking blueberry, with a ho 
Who know a few scary individuals eerie as she gets into it
Squares they into voodoo
She says a Hail Mary and she says she knew who
Would come and try to kill you too      


A Mastermind - Sees it coming before it comes
A Mastermind - Before he go to war he counts his one
A Mastermind - Everything planned out perfect, in case y'all niggaz got to get murdered

ltl2('Nas','Mastermind')

[Verse1]
They can't break me or shake me
They too fake to come kill me
Think they faith this was satan
They mistake me I'm filthy
Rich off the ghetto madness, so now they wanna dare me
It's gonna be a murder confront me, the burners are empty
Middle Passage I made it I'm from the land of David
The Nazarene of Bethlehem they had me wrapped in blankets
That bunch of backward gangsters
That sign of Alpha Davis
Snitches with smile-like faces got you blowin' trial I hear this
Hopin' my child can see through this tryna be a good daddy
I was there when she was born and she'll be there when I'm buried
Kind o' waitin' is scary
All my years have prepared me
What I fear is my temper, I subject to the center
Right through a man's soul
Straight through his eyes, straight through his heart I'm still alive how did I make it this far
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found
I guess it's just a warrior's way 

[Chorus (1): Alicia Keys]
This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
Definition of a warrior
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 

[Verse2]
Like King Nasir fightin' the
British regime I can't cope my existence is hope for younger teens who lost in their world
Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket
Your mother's the closest thing to
God that you ever have kid I'm askin, what would you do at your own mom's funeral
Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real
Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but
I can't keep still I can't go on, responsible for so many
Her last days at the hospital
Visits from family I'm tryin' not to bust shots at niggas
Wishin' death on other nigga's mothers ain't right but why mommy
She raised me in the projects alone
Her untimely exit from her, heavenly body
Got me ready to embody somethin' quickly
Can't be happy, f*ck a party she can't party with me
So your apologies are burnin' ya own souls
To the kids with no parents at home, grab a whole 

[Chorus (2): Alicia Keys]
This is the song, for my warriors
A warrior song
Bravehearted and strong, definition of a warrior
(Uh, warriors)
Gonna keep marchin' on, to the sound of her own beatin' drum 

[Verse3]
Fight 'til the fight is over, for my peoples I die see
When you thought they were soldiers they turned out to be nobodies
I think they out to get me, helpless was livin' sinful If you was me
all this pain I'm feelin would bend and killed you
(I'm a Warrior)
It only made me stronger
But in my head it gets darker who wishin' evil on ya
Sometimes I wish I was dead
But I took heed to the cause
(I'm a Warrior, yeah)
'Cause I been high I been low, searchin' for a way to go
Every single night I pray
And Lord I'm on this battleground, lost just waitin' to be found I guess it's just a warrior's way 

[Chorus x3 (1) Until End: Alicia Keys]

 
To my warriors
To all these, baby Krucial
Keys! Braveheart y'all
This to all my warriors, who breathe with the heart of a lion
To everybody that lost their mother, their father
Rest in peace moms!
My mother's last words:
Never give up
A true warrior, who raised me in the hood, in a war
Love ya girl, y'kno keep marchin'
Yea yea yea, you never give up
To all my warriors, haha
Braveheart, Braveheart
Definition of a warrior



[Lake] uh uh huh, lets go, yeah!
  Uh,   children singing "singing"
  See   eager to learn "uh hum"
  how to   the next world leaders "Bravehearts"!

[Chorus: Nas]
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here
Revolutionary warfare is all fair loving war for the cause
I gotta take you off here

 
Book one, strategy, tactics, techniques
Look dumb, but massively notice the weakness, in all them
Gotta shoot only if necessary 
Homey vest is very real if enemies carrying heavy steal
Beware the thugs who ain't scared of blood or jail time
Where Arian nations ain't having integration, we so blind
The beauty of life, was when my mom said nigga you could be Christ
I wasn't old enough to hold my dick and pee right, "Jesus"!
What is he like? I picture him standing with diamonds on him
Little different from the way my mommy saw him
Practice your aiming, physical training in, difficult terrain and
Test your endurance, try to keep your stamina banging
Splitting dutches up, strap up, the armies is school 
Teaching smart ways to kill, I'm thinking Ghandi was a fool
But chronic's a fool; got me thinking out loud, f*ck it
Sleep on my drunkenness I'll blow your brains out 



[Lake]
My revolution is as real as Bobby Seale's, I build
With dudes and cribs worth a quarter mill, in dix hills
for fish scale, to cop guns, the time come
I'll mask up and get my comrade off the bus
F*ck the beef I'll snatch your seed, from chuckie cheese 
And feed him to the rats in the back of the P's 
Black fatigues and ? on the sofa
50 inch flat screen Louie Vitton holdsters
My motions don't appeal to repel at divisions
I did it strong for 7 long years in prison, f*ck the system
I'm like a modern day Hitler, black gorilla, crip and blood in one nigga
Only killas know my face
I beat a case for shooting at the police, nigga, the name Lake
Though simultaneously the street revolution 
21 gun salute the new Huey Newton 



[Nas, Lake]
[N] Teach y'all women how to hold the family down in case something happens to his fathers
[N] Protect the children, grab revolvers
[N] The women plays important part of our life force
[N] So what we fight for, my heart goes to you beautiful wife in war
[L] Uh, And listen more talk less
[L] Watch all and trust none, demand your respect
[L] And be ready to die for what you believe in
[L] And ride all the time not just when convenient 
[N] Justice and freedom, wisdom and understanding
[N] We the lost children of Israel in this western world region
[N] You ain't a man you a coward if you cant support the girl you put a seed in
[L] Strong rule the weak, but the wise rule the strong
[L] It's more to a war than just getting it on
[L] Conceal your form, cover your tracks
[L] Stay prepared I don't care if no one's spared

[Chorus: x2]




One more time, one more time
Huh, one more time, huh
One more time

I dream of the day I could go back to when I was born
Laying in your arms, wishing you was here today mom
Wish you'd appear
Just for a second from heaven my tears would be gone
I wouldn't be rapping this song
I'd be happy driving up to your 8 bed room mansion
Up late, laughing bout the hard time we faced
The galaxy is so enchanting beyond, Galileo's understanding
Past the milky way and all the planets
There's something out there greater
But only god knows, scientist claim we came from apes
But they lies though, that was part of our conversation
I spark went up a star blazing
Thinking of how amazing she was
A angel gave me love
I'm thankful, to ever know a women so real
I pray when I marry my wife'll have one of your skillz
But mom you could never be replaced
I'd give my life up
Just to see you one more day
To have...


One more dance with you mama
If I could only have
One more dance with you mama
Praying, wish that I could have
One more dance with you mama
If I could only have
One more dance with you mama

I wish you were here,
I miss you more each second I breathe
You resting in peace forever I accepted you free
A blessing to me, I see you dressed in all white
Smiling at me, happy knowing everything's all right
If only I could hear your voice and your laughter
Just one more time, my chest would be filled up with sunshine
April 7, 02
That's when the gates of heaven opened up for you to stroll threw
Beautiful Anne Jones
Job is done, raising ghetto kids in the hood
You was my strength to carry on and now I'm good
Job well done, you lived through you sons and your grandchildren
Jesus finally got his bride, mommy dance with em
And you've been my guide threw all the trouble I faced
They playing our song the lifebeat my hand on your waist
I grab your other hand and try not to step on your toes
Spin you around with my eyes closed
Dreaming I could have



I love you forever mom
You will always live threw me ... always
Huh, huh huh, yea





(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I pack up my bags and leave this world behind?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Or save it all for you?
(If Heaven was a mile away)
Would I, fill the tank up with gas and be out the front door in a FLASH
Before reconsidering, this Hell with you
It ain't you it's the things you do (do)
It's tearing my heart in two
I would of fell with you
To Hell with you

 
If Heaven was a mile away
And you could ride by the gates
Would you try to run inside when it opens would you try to die today?
Would you pray louder finally believing His power?
Even if you couldn't see, but you could feel would you still doubt him?
How would you start acting?
Would you try to put the ki's down?
Thinking every drug sell that you make in the streets He can see now
Would a fiend even want to get high, would he s  smoking?
If he knew on his own two feet he could just stroll in
To get away and escape from the craziness
And I bet you there's a Heaven for an atheist
It's hard taking this
Racist planet where they take another brother in a handcuff
Even if he innocent nigga get on the car put your motherf*cking hands up
Thinking I'm a lose it
My mom's in chemo
Three times a week, yo keep trying but people
Is hard and God your young soldier's not so bold
But needs you
This world's my home but world I would leave



 
Nigga what you think I'ma s  building
I'ma s  feeling like I'm Amistad's great great grandchildren
How I'm not gonna want to make millions
Since the quarter water days in the hallways making fake coke
Pass with the Reeses Pieces wrapper in my mouth all day
But then my style has quite a while that same type as Ill and Al Skratch
Game time to them cats never looked back Cristal blowing dub sacks
That's when it all just hit me
You see the broads and Bentleys is nothing less my nigga spend it all with me
I'd give it all away quickly
Just to hear them all I'd buy some new kicks free of any autographs so
not to be recognized forgive me
It's becoming unbearable 
Making hits is easy
Put a famous bitch on the hook there you go with a platinum CD
I know you heard the noise
Preachers touching on altar boys
Sodomizing not realizing God is watching before the Lord
How can they do the devil's work?
A man giving another man head in church
Hell it hurts just to fathom the thought wishing that I fled the Earth.




Yo, my man was regulatin on niggas he used to thug with
Older niggas in this murder game, drug czars
BM, Jaguars, they cash was large
Since he was wild, they let him in
He did a crazy number of things
To put himself deeper under they wing
It didn't take long for duke to get on
Studied they movements - who would kill, who was strong
Studied like a student, got it bloody, he was shootin
Drivin they cars, robbin connects
Drivin his Lex, keys was movin
Young don, now they know they weakness
They never seen it comin
Son was on some real take over the streets hit
Now he got his own crew of young guns clickin now
Richer now, now they run shit, see how it flips around?


Dudes be, comin from bids thinkin shit is different
Cause the streets move fast, you blink, you could miss it
I just sit back and, think of my last 20 years
6 pack, gunnin my years, jet black, blunt in my ear
Real relaxed, readin real loves stories like
Ceaser and Cleopatra, we need another actress to play her
Cause Liz Taylor's hot, but the Egyptian queen
On the movie screen needs to be portrayed in a proper flava
Hopped in the shower, threw on the boxers with the baby oil
Baby powder, night owl, movin to later hours, only
F*ckin with kings, niggas official
If you phony, come in the circle, niggas'll diss you
We converse on the state of hip hop
We share the same views and feelings
He sling cain, crib costin 2 million
He plan to leave the streets forever
But niggas that wanted him left him 
Dead in the streets 'fore I can tell him





Yo pussy kill me
Ugh Ugh
Ya ya ya
Huh
Ugh Ugh Ugh

Pussy kill me when I was born (what)
Pardon me I rephrase it departed mommy wound decayin
I look at the bright side, the fact that I got a life side
Born 73 (September right Nas)
True, Virgo child
The first thing I learned is money makes the world go round
On a small planet, its 10 women to 1 man
I wonder how we managed
To say vows and walk a straight line in marriage
Niggas is some nasty creatures, bitches even nastier
They throw it at your boy and it's hard for me to pass it up
Freaky ho's licken niggas ass and nuts
Stupid bitch bragen till her baby dad went nuts
And now were looking for me, 2 cars deep
Rollin up on niggas
Barrel out da window, Asking (you nas peeps)
I can't here dat 2 4 5 nigga grad at
Pass it to me sucker for love niggas I blast at
I swear my dick is gonna get me into trouble, I pissin bubble
I thought I felt a sharp pain betta stick to rubbers
When lain, hooker after hooker down and day
Watch out for diseases, the doctors can't name em
Just a thought we all f*ck the same chicks
Some play like they innocent
F*cken entertainers, and basket ball players
The bitch is a ho
But still some of yall il say ya put your dick in her dough
You're just a nigger that life to her, she thought your crazy
Now your monkey ass want to shoot the pimp that pipes her
She had your baby, now you a lifa
The suicide note you write her
Pussy kills

[Chorus X2]
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real
Pussy killz
Mad shots keep a nigga open
Bitch have a nigga's gun smoking
pussy killz

My nigga James got married same girl he went to school with
Nice girl, nerd with glasses, he was to stuck
Studied for her masters, part time nurse
I tell you how superb the ass is, but who's looking
And I mean that's my man, maybe I just took a peek
Maybe I wondered what it would be like, syke, cause James and me like
I was with A Z like, Luke and Han Solo
F*ckin with niggas girls, forbidden, that's a no no
It's death and we're real niggas civilized guards
And there ain't to many niggas like Nas I'm trust worthy
Plus I know a dude that caught his wife cheatin
Killed his baby, killed his wife, and took his own life even
Happy for James cause real bitches hard to come by
This nigga found one, I told him he was lucky an clown something
Rollin up duckies while watching Roy Jones in round one
He froze put his to the t.v. about an inch close
Move outa the way nigga what the f*ck the matter with you, you blind
He pointed to the front row, thought he was losing his mind
She was supposed to be with her sick mother
Left for the weekend, stress when she was leaving, now she next to some nigga cheesin
He's having trouble breathing (breathing)
He pictured them making noises, grindin em and kissin em
Yellin, ain't no telling where her lips have bin
Left her foul messages, she came home no lesser then
Ten minutes later and they start wrestling, and screamin
She said she missed her flight that evening
She never left, she wasn't at the fight u speakin
That's Vegas this is New York you bugin
I held up my hand for dat, but he wouldn't touch it
I was like when u started actin like that, this is dumbness
Gave me a crazy look and started swingin punches
I ducked couldn't believe it, the niggas so wet 
He got his gad and started squeezin, hit two police men
Neighbors dialed 911 they heard the thumpin
Wounded cops kicked in the door and started dumpin
Me and his wife hit to the floor she smelt strange
My comrade was breathing no more they killed James

[Chorus X2]
O what a thrill inside a bitch feel
Gotta be strong and handle, it is real
Pussy killz
Mad shots keep a nigga open
Bitch have a nigga's gun smoking
pussy killz






The G-O-D
Aiyyo, check it out...It's God's Son
I know I always give you clowns a little lean to come out
Cause I drop every two years...but it's over now, you know? Hah


The G-O-D S-O-N
K-I-N-G O-F N-Y-C
That's me [x4]


Is it because I got the city on smash now
Oh woe woe
Or is it because your time's up and it's a wrap now
Hey hey hey hey


In the papers you read that Nas is crazy
Lost his mind as he leavin Sony
The INC got him signed
It's only a figment of your imagination
Went to way with New York's Hot radio station
Lost my patience, had to zone out
Rappers blown out, I have the throne now
The real shall reign, I feel your pain
You R&B, follow me, spell my name






God's Son across the belly
Pardon, I'm hardly a bully
But what y'all done to hip hop is scary
Nas'll be truly the, last soldier to roll with
Holdin it down, my proteges are over with now
A producer like Swizz Beats, on fire
So is the control room, soon as my vocals are down
Nas - God's Son, and y'all my little children
So bounce with it, if you can pronounce the correct spellin

[Chorus x1]


Uhh

 
Pushin drop- s, Stacy Lattisaw tapes, the 80's had us all apes
Youngest gorillas up to bat at home plate
That was a uncanny era, guns in my pants
Yeah X-Clan hair, with dreads at the   of my fade
Homicide and feds on the blocks where I played, b-ball
That's when I wondered was I here for the cause, or be-cause
Cause Ray Charles could see the ghetto
Was told to stay strong and I could beat the Devil
Cause yo, I used to play Apollo balcony seats
Watchin niggaz swing razors in the front row, then out in the streets
The car show, 560's, chemical afros
Acuras pumpin Super Lover Cee and Casanova
Live chicks be, asses bustin out of they clothes
Wearin lip gloss, big door knockers pealin they earlobes
So where them years go?    Where the old gold beers and cheers go?
But now them shorties here doe, so


The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; one mo' time
The doo rags are back, fitted hats, snorkels and furs
Riker's Island bustin, still packed, what's the word?
The drinkers stay drinkin, or puffin they herb
And I'm, still enjoyin life's ride; right?

 
Political thugs in shark suits persuade us to pull triggers
in army boots, yellin "Join the armed forces!"
We lost the Vietnam War, intoxicated poisons
Needles in arms of veterans instead of bigger fortunes
There's still a lot of nigger callin in the coorporate offices
War in the ghetto, we crabs in a barrel, they torture us
They won't be servin the beast too long
The murderers wearin police uniforms, confederate flags I burn
Beat Street breakers were dancin to the music I chose
And Peachtree Atlantic crackheads was tootin they nose
in frozen corners of Chicago, loaded up Llama's children
with fo'-fo's, and double-revolvers
We devil incarnates, headed for jail
Where Shell gas company in South Africa be havin us killed
Your paper money was the death of Christ
And all these shorties comin up just resurrect your life
It's like a cycle



 
Niggaz used to wear rags on they hair when it was fried up
That's when we were lied to, buyin hair products
Back before my generation, when our blackness started disintegratin
'til awareness started penetratin
The styles come from prison, they used potatoes makin liquor
just to prove we some creative niggaz
Turnin nothin into somethin, is God work
And you get nothin without struggle and hard work
War is necessary to my niggaz in chains
From Greene to Sing-Sing, I'm wantin y'all to know one thing
The hardest thing is to forgive, but God does
Even if you murdered or robbed, yeah it's wrong, but God loves
Take one step toward him, he takes two toward you
Even when all else fail, God support you
I done it, got God Son on my stomach
My heart and my lungs was affected from Henny's and gettin blunted
Do your body right and it loves you back
You only get one life, and yo because of that
I'm still blazin, goin out for the cause
Still rockin stockin caps, not for the waves, obeyin no laws
And it's like that

Word to Will, buried in his fila suit and heavy chain
I wanna be iced-up nigga, bury me the same
I live for street glory and I die for ghetto fame
Respect all, fear none, my pride is everything
Initials in swimming pools floors, women lose draws
A true boss, never lose wars, got cheddar to floss
Guns under beds, mask and a flashlight
Living my life like everyday's my last night
Alcoholic on toilets, I shit blood
Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug
Mama told me from weed, I would switch drugs
To cocaine and hit clubs and deep-dish dubs
How would she know unless she hit the clubs, got her mack-on
Back in the 60's with an afro and her platforms
Bopping to the supremes, smoking joints
That's cool, but I'ma live how I want

[Chorus 1]
I did it my way, from crumbs and roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, from break dancing, back spins on the cardboard
I did it my way, to bullet proof bentleys, gats in the car's door
I did it my way, never gave a f*ck what nobody said
I did it my way, they hope that I fail and wished I was dead
I did it my way, if I f*cked op it falls on me
I did it my way, I'm lucked up and struck rich, now we all can eat

 
Gateways, marble floors, chandeliers
Juzzi's, gucci soap, throwing cash in the air
Though I, still feel broke with millions in the bank
And deals on the table, I focus to stay afloat
And just to think some would die to get with I got
They think its alot, the blink of an eye, you could get shot
Niggas is wolves, coming if you ruthless or not
But i be on point, put you in places where bodies rot
Never knew murder till I seen my man get popped
No blood soaking, laying there, eyes still open
I got a little closer, put my hand in his palm
He was looking right through me, Yo staring beyond
I wonder what he saw, the limoes, movies and tours
Did he die in vain and represent for the cause
Now I put his name on everything I'm involved
And that's the game, Ya'll can't relate, f*ck ya'll (Ill Will)

[Chorus 2]
I did it my way, from crumbs, roaches and rats
I did it my way, converted in from hustling to raps
I did it my way, I call it how I see it niggas
I did it my way, if you don't like it so be it niggas
I did it my way, I make my own rules, I do my own plans
I did it my way, gangstas do what they want
Suckers do what they can't
I did it my way, taking sacrifices kid
I did it my way, but now you only getting one life to live

 
Yo, hoes in my fold can slow me, roll with the brokest homies
Cold and we hopeless lonelies, scolding my foes who phony
From blocks where coke can feed you and cops are over evil
They know some people who tell on felons who sold some diesil
Here on and blow it rurals, its mine, knew a crew one time
'89, they took work to Caroline and blew big time
In just two years, their crew disappear
Snitches and bitches, smeared the paint on their pictures
Years back, I reminiscence and remember, sitting on wood benches
Gave me splinters, just a baby nigga thankful
When them killers came through, guns out, moving
I think the ones who said shorty go home, we about to be shooting




Real conversation for that ass
(Its what they want) Huh
(Its what they want) What you said, can't hear you man
(Its what they want) Speak the f*ck up
(Its what they want) Word (Its what they want)

 
Nastradumas, astrologic, know when I rep
Flow when I'm set, got the chips to a lotus my whip
Gold on my neck was once a code of respect
For high rollers and vets
Now its loads of baguettes, prefer a mack-10 over a tech
No matter sober or wet, I smack soldiers, cadets
Trees that might eject my hype back
Famous phrase "Nigga light that"
Hoes you f*ck, ask you where your ice at, dun
Its all about playboys, when we was young
Can only get tongue, then finally we can cum
Busting in hoes, guzzling 4's
Crack blitz, '86, you turn hustling pro
From bottles, to seven in your hand
To fake pepsi's to get to the crack, unscrew the can
Gleam blunted, seeing 100's, stacks of boy with a lean on it
We got it if the fiends want it
The whole block singing the same theme "Don it"
F*ck it, too many crabs in the bucket
If its ice work, I'm gonna truck it
You gotta love it, you gotta love it


(Its what they want) f*ck it
(Its what they want) you gotta love it
(Its what they want) f*ck it
(Its what they want) you gotta love it
(Its what they want) f*ck it
(Its what they want) you gotta love it
(Its what they want) (its what they want) (its what they want)

 
Some girls get too emotional, fanatic extremist
Get pulsive with malice insentitives, the foulest of bitches
Hung up my riches, her childest wishes
Be suspicious of those sleeping with fishes, them hoes
Conspicuous and it shows, tricking this dough
Kicking this flow, slip in a new fo'
So when your click roll, I let my clips go, Niggas on opposite polls
I got that confident soul, for those locked in a hole
Inhuman, living hostile opposed
To living on the streets, proper from my   to my toes
Aeropostale my clothes, Vernon niggas in suburbans with liquor
Preposterous foes, frantically foul niggas
See niggas in blast, there goes a loud difference
Coke sniffing, tapping 13 year old chickens
You can't be a kingpin when you snitching
Regardless, we still make you a target
We shoot you and chill, chrome objects
Hit you in your projects, its street anomics
This rhyme is edited, credited through ebonics
Miserable cats, hunger painting
Get off your ass, s  complaining
My crew be in Montego Bay margariting 
While you home, waiting your arraignment
This thug life you claimed it, I make millions from entertainment 
Now back in the hood, certain cats they wanna kill me
They ice grill me, but on the low, niggas feel me
You gotta love it, you gotta love it


(Its what they want) f*ck it
(Its what they want) you gotta love it
(Its what they want) f*ck it
(Its what they want) you gotta love it
(Its what they want) (its what they want) (its what they want)



A lot of times it seems like, you ain't gon' make it where you wanna be in life
But, yo if you got a plan, believe me you gon' get there
You gon' get everything you ever wanted baby
That's my word

Trust, my niggas come home from long bids
They check for me before they see their own kids
I open up accounts for 'em, we bounce tour in
major cities, arenas, headline with big time singers
Cop Ferraris with navigational screens
guide us through your hood and any locality, head back to Queens
Piped out seats, Oakwood mb cord speakers
Bumpin' out old shit
That made me think of Old Easters '86 in a le tigre short sleeves
Lees, flip the cuffs up, gettin' f*cked up
from Old E, Fresh Fest, niggas got hurt
100 niggas rush the door with Queensbridge tournament shirts
Back then, nobody wore a vest
Pull out razors, you had to put your hand skills to the test
Get your Pumas took, come home barefoot willin'
Look at the chain I snatched with a medallion worth a thousand
Cops rushed the garden made it home smilin'
Half of the crew probably on the island
Project call play puff ball the hoop was made out of a hanger
Playin' corners stick the elevator never thought
Project life was promised nothin' but to die trife
for steppin' on the next man's nikes my motto look for tomorrow
Today is yesterday look at the hood now, I'm mad that it turned out that way
Gats spray these shorties is killers
The older G's taught us well, what's wild now is that they're smaller
And they look at me like I'm on the outside lookin' in
Like 'who's you' when I cruise through
I call shorty took him in watch your friends, get ends
be clever, realize that today's the first day that begins forever

Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
Cuz nothin' lasts forever

Everything will eventually come to an end
So try to savor the moment, cuz time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
Cuz nothin' lasts forever

Nice cars, livin' like a star club hoppin'
Poppin' bottles at the bar love shoppin'
Gucci iceberg, coppin' two, three nice furs
One for your wife, one for your freak silver spurs
Rolls Royce too good to be true, houses worth 2.2
Pool parties beautiful view
You made it in life, Forbes Magazine style baggy jeans style
Pass the green while hoes wit' meanwhile
Asses, pretty mommies illest bodies pass glasses
Louis Roderra with Peach Schnapps you just relaxin'
Thinkin' damn wish my niggas could afford this
On the sand at your Malibu house holdin' a cordless
Talkin' to lawyers accountants investments
Money doubles, triples protected hard work you manifested
Worries of failure, when you buried will your familia
Keep your name prosperin' to the maximum
You should live, there's only one life that's the physical
Rich or poor in jail why the f*ck should you be miserable
Things happen for reasons, the clock keeps tickin'
Love could have your heart beat skippin', thugs turn to religion
The bitch you love could start to hate you, the shit you use to do escape you
Things that make you laugh represent the past
Reminisce the block gamble gees on the floor
Niggas use to be the man, you don't see 'em no more
Your favorite restaurants and favorite stores, they tore 'em down
Turn 'em into shopping malls the hood is like a ghost town
Haunted by souls who thought that time stood still
Just live your life to the fullest, never look back, it's real

Everything must eventually come to an end
So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
Cuz nothin' lasts forever, ya know

I said everything eventually comes to an end
So try to savor your moments, cuz time flies don't it
The beauty of life, you gotta make it last for the better
Cuz nothin' lasts forever
Ya know, ya now, nothin' lasts forever ya know let it go, let it go




Uhh, uhh
Uhhh, uhhh, uhhh

[Intro: repeat 2X]
No idea's original, there's nothin new under the sun
It's never what you do, but how it's done
What you base your happiness around material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major

 
If niggaz could look inside my mind, you'll find
where bodies are buried, first look past the hotties who dimes
Go to the center, enter with caution, past the braincell graveyard
where weed's responsible for memory loss
Let's witness, the horrific, the stench'll make you nauseous
See what I seen every day I live with this torture
Lightin spliffs up to stay high like 24 hours
Sleep with my heat, wash with my gun in the shower
My tongue is power, it thrills women, kills demons
Long as I'm still breathin I'm still winnin, I'll teach 'em
The hood converted from trey bags to 20's a girl
Everybody had money, every summer was real ill
Four-finger rings, dope dealers, 'caine/Kane
"No Half Steppin'" with flat  s when Rakim reigned
Radios on card tables, Benetton, the Gods buildin
Ask for today's mathematics, we Allah's children
And this was goin on in every New York ghetto
Kids listened, Five Percenters said it's pork and Jell-o
We coincide, we in the same life, maybe a time difference
on a different coast, but we share the same sunlight
Your part of the world, might be like colors and gangs
While on my side, brothers'll murder for different things
But it all revolve around drugs, fame and shorties
Stuck for your bling, stripped for your chain, the same story
From, Czechoslovakia to Texas metropolis
Them, treacherous rocksters in the Mexican mafias
Be scrappin with tats on they back, violent wars
Nothin less than a lethal injection if ever caught
Courtrooms, eagles and flags, American style
While in our world, the ghetto stays incredibly foul
Watchin for paint chips, don't want no led in yo' child
But them gangstas put lead in yo' child, the bezzy be out
The chain be like a hundred K
Shinin since Roxanne Shante' made "Runaway"; that's been a minute
Genesis is deep, my features are that of a God
It's not a facade it's a fact, these rappers wanna be Nas
My Exodus doesn't exist
I'll never leave the streets, it's all in my mind
Even with sleep I'm duckin nines in my dreams
Si-rens, wide awake, why'd I think it would change
Can't hide when you famous or even try to do the same things like
Somebody's always watchin, my life
Before I, walk out the door I size up every option
Eyes cut every direction, it's like God or guns
Which is better protection?    Can't decide, that's a hard one
I mean they wanna see me in prison, the chains bamboozled

  down, nightmare, blow her hair
sky black, stars glow, the face on the moon stare.
fast lane on the nine-five, honey laughs about the cash.
took a blast, out of her coke bag.
snorted it, started screamin yo we almost crashed!
earlier i took the coke out, replaced it wit crushed up glass.
her head nodded down to her chest, slowly she fell asleep.
overwhelmed by greed, put to death.



Nasir bin Olu Dara bis do Allah
Fisk full of dollars in a dice game god
D & D glass cloth Kangols guided by angel with white wings
Nas the Viking fresh from my ankles thankful
Gangster see gangster do I'm Langston Hughes predecessor
Gun on my dresser slang I use upset college professor
More knowledge than Webster dictionary obituary column plus sign 'em
the first fake rapper murdered for rhyming
The jig is up gut 'em like fish swiss cheese 'em up
My wrist is freezing up sick of these ducks on my hiatus
Poking out their chest like they tall as sky scrapers
But they small as a shanty in a African village 
Soft as cotton candy we assassins and killers 
Let shottie off in club floors pellets spraying your familia
You screaming like you love war

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Everybody's crazy 
Somebody's gonna get shot get rob get done get stomp get drop
Ladies love thugs and my thug love hip hop
Thugs love ladies and ladies they love hip hop

 
Peace f*ck you with a fist in your ass
You pussy with yeast, you shook of the streets, you a Sisqo fag
You know blood baths I makes 'em fake thugs I hate 'em
8 slug I'm bustin' no discussion or waiting
Cause now Instead of coke rhymes it's laying
No analog it's digital criminals turned rapper times is changing
niggaz get flashier houses more plusher 
Bitches giving ass up at ages more younger
Hands on the clock keep turning, hands on a glock they keep squeezing
Bullets s  in your sternum they s  you from breathing
I'm light year far your mouth get all white
when I'm near you I frighten your heart
I want you to watch me notice stare look closely
Feel I'm who you posed to be real I know it hurts you
Soldiers approach you, you want to squash it, you older than most dudes
Although Nas did you and your whole crew, but



 
I know where niggaz sleep; it's too many schemes too many plots
War plus money man I got too many spots
Hungry niggaz get tutored to thinking new shit to come up
Killers f*ck with killers you sleeping you getting stuck up
Not me your not ready I'm low but I be watching
We all connected so your man know my man
Your man knows my fam' they was cool when they was locked up
Beat cases and now niggaz back on the block what
Bothers is taking secret routes when they drive
Tinted windows ears to the street stay on their job
Peep niggaz that go t prices on their head so high
Their own my will take the contract surprise
So we play a mental game intimidation 
Got pussy niggaz get pressed up on and paying
I wish these niggaz would step up wait for the day an
Since I'm famous they thinking assault rifles won't be spraying
Who ever thinking coming to my vault for the safe
I got some niggaz with acid get it thrown in your face
Play dirty catch your moms in J-30
Whatever whodie we all crazy we all 7:30 now

Light it, uhh
Light it up, uhh

 
The whole, city is mine, prettiest Don
I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers
Why it's mentioned in my rhymes?    F*ck it, it's just an intro
Hate it or love it, like it bump it or dump it
Writing, across the stomach spell GOD son
Life is like a jungle black it's like the habitat of Tarzan
Matter of fact, it's harder than most can imagine
Most of my niggaz packed in correctional facilities
Half of them passed on, mack strong, couple of shots
May the ghost leave a body, now they hauntin the block
Where they used to stand at, somebody's takin they place
A younger man perhaps, hand slaps, can't understand that
Same walk, same talk, I wonder can that be possible
A thug dies, another step inside his shoes
And they will hurt you, layin low with a bottle
I'm blowin circles, my state of mind purple

Light it, light it, uhh
Yeah.. light it up, light it up, uhh

Y'all just wanna deal with drama
Talk about niggaz who got things, y'all ready to kill his momma
Everything you went to is underworld related
You sell your man out, not even your girl is sacred
You don't trust a soul, hold up, you moldin soldiers
to pull guns quick and always look behind the shoulder
Think of how many dudes died tryin to be down with you
Everybody's under six feet of ground but you
Still standin, still roamin through the streets, that's real
You a survivor, knowin all the beef is ill
You got a bunch of thugs witchu even now that's ready
Trustin your judgment, quick to put it down, they deadly
The hood love you but behind your back they pray for the day
A bullet hit your heart and ambulances take you away
That ain't love it's hate, think of all the mothers at wakes
whose sons you killed, and you ain't got a cut on your face?
Unmarked police cars roam the streets hard, the heat is God
Somebody tell these shorties reach for the stars
Instead they tell 'em how to reach through the bars, holdin a mirror
Lookin down a tear in jail, makin weapons to kill ya
We smoke three tokes nigga pour more Henny
He sighs with eyes that seen a war too many
Cold-blooded murderers, universal
Hood to hood, blowin smoke, state of mind is purple

Light it up, light it up light it up, uhh
Light it up.. light it up, light it up, uhh
Uhh.. uhh, uhh, light it, light it, uhh

These hot-headed youngsters, always get into trouble
Reactin before thinkin, they easily irritated
And murder's premeditated, it's a fact that we sinkin
when we should be climbin, in a nutshell, it's just jail
Drug sales, liquor and diamonds, niggaz rewindin
instead of movin forward, to blow up so what's the science?
People shoutin, police pushin the crowd
And on the ground's a young soldier, with meat hangin out him
Am I hallucinatin off the hazin?
Or did I just see a nigga shoot another nigga's face in
It's a ugly nation, cops circle the block with mug shots
Photograph pictures of, suspect faces
It's usually, two or three niggaz who innocent
But if they lock the wrong ones up, then someone'll snitch
A divide and fall strategy, they aren't fair
I dig in my bag of weed that's covered with orange hair
This Color Purple'll make Whoopi give me the pussy
(?) Oprah and Danny Glover gots to feel me
This is how I escape the madness, too much of anything'll hurt you
So, my state of mind's all purple




Uhh,Uhh, Where am I going?
Where am I? Yo, it's ill



Yo my wife's tired of f*cking me
Life tries ducking me
Luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in 
My left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, keeping myself in
Wolves in the night yo, hells men
Two revolvers I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit
Buck-sixty, who wit' me? My (?) to well 
Twisted blunts and inner conscience
Telling me that I aint shit
No matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain
Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive the cooler pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, f*cked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starved for more to eat
Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games
Niggas snitchin', I aint saying names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang
Lost so many close niggas, drunk almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patrol will just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they s  me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead
Yo nigga watch me

    

I'm drunk by myself, gun under my seat
I don't want none of my peeps caught up in none of my beef
I'm a ride to the end of the road if I have to
Praying no car speeds by for me to crash to
Steering wheel in my hand
Trying to hold it steady
Anything in my way is dead
Cause that's the way I feel, I am already
When I'm drunk by myself alone in the zone
Drunk by myself



Heard niggas hate me, but I hated too once
Been in the shoes of a Wolf in the night when he hunts
For every shell niggas bust, we bust at ourselves
Can't tell them niggas nothing though, bullets wak'em up well
Take them to hell
Stick up niggas once ran up on me
My deckited lifestyle attracted sharks on me
I aint your mark homey
It's hard to look straight, my foot on the brake
Spilling my bottle not even shook of the Jakes
Could hardly look both ways, put out the hayes blurry vision
Think about the time in my life before I was in televison
Hella women, jealous niggas up in my vision
Since we all hood niggas expect kilos
For what they not seeing is police expect Rico
Only if I could take care of everybody, intoxicated
Windows up blastin A.C. going wherever instinct takes me
I hate it when I'm like this
The bottle's my accomplice

[Chorus: 1x]



The reason that I want to be alone 
Tired of all the things that went wrong 
That would have went right if I would have did it on my own
Take another swigg
The more I drink, the more I think bad thoughts
Fake friends who hung around who wanna bring you down
Not knowing who to trust, runors about niggas coming through
Supposedly to shoot at us, not knowing what was true
Or what to believe, that's why I'm on the low lately
Choosing a Henny bottle over a friend, lost again
To keep my mind off that weak shit
There's love through it all, things to live for
I swerve, almost crash into a wall
Think about the good, find myself laughing
Turn the cell off, no way to be reached
Know I'm near my crib, trying to see my way through the streets
Reminded of the positive, I take my drunk ass home
Start feeling out of it, can't wait to get out of this whip
Bring my ass to the crib
I'm tired...

[Chorus: 1x]



Uhh

 
Yo, you believe when they say we ain't shit, we can't grow?
All we are is dope dealers, and gangstas and hoes?
And you believe when they be tellin you lie, all on the media?
They make the world look crazy to keep you inside?
Why you listen when the teachers at school
know you a young single parent out strugglin, they think you a fool
Give your kids bad grades and put 'em in dumber classes
Killin shorty future, I wonder how do we last it
Underground in they casket?    Ancestors turnin
I'm learnin somethin every day, there is no Lazareth
Words like God is Greek or Latin
So if you study Egypt, you'll see the truth written by the masters
My niggaz is chillin, gettin high, relaxin
Envisionin, ownin shit, yo it can happen
What do we own?    Not enough land, not enough homes
Not enough banks, to give a brother a loan
What do we own?    The skin on our backs, we run and we ask
for reperations, then they hit us with tax
And insurance if we live to be old, what about now?
So s  bein controlled, we black zombies

[Chorus: (sung)]
Walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)
Walkin talkin dead, though we think we're livin (black zombies)
We just copy-cat, followin the system (black zombies)

 
Aiyyo we trapped in our own brain, f*ck behind bars
We've already gone insane
They've already gave up, cut our own heads offs
Stab our own backs and dream too much
without fulfillin reality; too greedy and
can't have one or two chains, we need three of dem
Can't have one or two guns without squeezin 'em
on our own people and, f*ck black leaders
cause whites ain't got none leadin them, the rhythm is cosmic
Nas is divinity, the deity's prophetless
All get down and get up
Victims walkin 'round with Down's Syndrome, all stuck
Faintin, shoutin, catchin Holy Ghost in church
Scared to do it for ourselves 'less we see somebody doin it first
We begged, we prayed, petitioned and demostrated
Just to make another generation - black zombies



 
You scared to be yourself, cause you in a trance
Feel free, hear the music and dance
If you cared what they think, why wear what they wear, just for you
Dumb niggaz with long beards like they Arabs or Jews
or from Israel, (?)bish'meal Allah, el-rachman, el-Rahim (?)
Islam's a beautiful thing
And Christian and Rastafari, helps us to bring
peace against the darkness, which is unGodly
So what's the black man's true religion, who should we follow?
Use your own intuition, you are tommorrow
[roaring] .. that's the sound of the beast
I'm a Columbia record slave, so get paid
Control your own destiny, you are a genius
Don't let it happen to you like it did to me, I was a black zombie



 
Wake up!    Black zombies in a spell for more than fo'-hundred years
Ghetto niggaz won't have it no mo', can I get a witness?
Why listen to somebody else tell you how to do it
when you can do it yourself; it's all in you, do it, do it
Do it niggaz..

To My Nigger who brought me in this world
Taught us right Nigger

My old dad imported to the family structure
Provide her God
My moms a queen at university civaliza
My pops maybe was late but always came home
My moms would put us to bed and she would wait on
Soon as he walk in the door she barking
I turned out the Jonny Carson
Jumped out the bed
We grabbed both his legs
Me and my brother
Not knowing the pain he gave my mother
Night after night, fighting yelling at each other
My papa played the street all day
Mama was either home, at work, while we played inside the hall way
She sacrifices all she got to feed us
When she was alone she cried by the phone pepping out the window heeding
But still I didn't see it
Mama hid it from us
We was kids younger
Till we got bigger, on to
Bigger things that we knew what the time was
That daddy was leaving the crib and moms love

Papa was player, player wasn't papa 
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (Shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
[Repeat 2x]

So many kids I knew, never knew what Pap was
That's why I show my pop love
He was still around when I f*cked up
He could have left
My moms pregnant shock to death but stayed
Watch me crawl till I took my first step, to the first grade
To my first fist fight
Right behind me he would stand
No matter how big or tall he made me fight you like a man
Throw dirt in your eye, swing my right scoop your ass and slam 
He watched me so I wouldn't get jumped by shorty's fam
Roaches and weed all over my crib him and moms relaxing
Next thing you know he packing
So then I asked him
What's this white shit on that plate and your facing?
Papa why you butt ass from the waist
And who's this lady I'm facing
Dark skin you're not my mommy
He grabbed me up to run some smooth words by me
Promise things that he would buy me
If I kept my mouth close and don't tell mommy
He said one day I'll understand little me
Was in you to side me

Papa was player, player wasn't papa 
Papa loved the ladies
Never got enough of
Pretty brown round
Running round town (Shhhhh)
Don't tell your mother what's going down
[Repeat 2x]

Pop's told me hold my own
Pop's told me value home
Could I help it papa was a rolling stone
Who loved the pretty brown round
Out of town bound 
Jumping in his jazz Benz he touring
At home I play his latest recordings
And it's strange now how, I do my thing now
I'm in the game now
And heard of it his brain pow
To pull strings and gain power
From weed habits are same now
No white lines to trumpets to tight rhymes
And beats that be pumping
Before he left he taught me something
A child's young years the most important time to be there
That's why he stayed till we grew up, respect is still here
I'm older now see what having a father's about
One day they can be in your life next day they be out
It's not because of you, you know the deal
Him and your moms feel
If they stay together then someone will get killed
I love you still
Always will
Cause that's my nigger
Although you felt you was wrong
I still feel you kid
Life gose on





Yeah
I want all my niggas to come journey with me
My name is Nas, and the year is 1973
Beginning of me, therefore I could see
Through my belly button window who I am...

I existed in a womb, just like an abyss
Came straight from spirit land, my hands balled in a fist
Punching on my moms stomach, kicking on her cervix
Twitching cause I'm nervous
Thought my intended purpose
Was to be born to reign, not in scorn or vain
But to take on a name, my pops chose for me
Bloodstream full of indo
Developing eyes looking out my belly button window
My father's face wears a frown
And I'm wondering if they even want me around
Cause I'll go back to spirit town
So I could rest longer before I come back down
The chute again, in the near future when
My moms and pops can agree on this
Was here before but my moms saw her gynocologist
He dumped me off, first they want me then turn around and they dont
You got a 120 days do what you want
But as for me coming back this be my last time
Abort me, keep me, give me away, make up ya mind

 
I shot my way out my mom dukes

I shot my way out my mom dukes

They must wanna keep me, cause    4 months past and I'm still alive
Guess I got what you call an ill-will to survive
When I look hard the lights is killing my eyes
I know when moms is laying down cause I get bored and start to get live
Move side to side hear loud music and vibe
All black babies are born with rhythm thats no lie
Solar energize, mineralize food through my mothers tube
I'm covered in this thick layer of goo
Month two was the least most comfortable
My umbilical cord choking me
But month 3 was closer, see
Thats when pops took    moms to see the doc at the clinic
But I was saved cause he changed his mind in the last minute
Watching 'em yell, heard my moms voice well
Feared fist fights, so terrified when we fell
While they broke up furniture and smashed plates on the wall
I wondered if I am born will I be safe at all
This place they call the world though my view was so large
Couldn't wait to get up, grow up and take charge
Month 5, Month 6 went by, hoping I'm born in July
But the Lord already figured out a date and time
Septemeber 14th, 73
Get ready world, doctors in the front waiting for me
Arms open cause they know when I drop, alot of shit's gonna s 
See how the goverment will start re-training cops
Month 9, I'm a week over due, the labor induced
Pops told my moms to push and take deep breaths too
Said stay calm, holding her arm, I'm trying to hold on
Surgical gloves touching my scalp, my head pops out
Everything blurry, my first breath screams out
Tears pouring down my pops face he's so proud
Wanted to hold me, but I was so bloody
They washed me off and he said "At least that nigga aint ugly!"
Placed me in his arms snuggly, laid me on my mother
Finally, I got to see who held me in her body
She loved me,and I plan to over through the devil
Y'all bout to see this world in trouble
Motherf*ckers...





ltl2('Nas','Fetus')







    
Girls I got 'em locked so similar to a prison
Hear this monster jam, I be callin' it 'GANGSTERISM'
I murder you for dope, I'm the street distributor
I'm homicidal, pointin' the pump, scope to shoot you
Street connects, Mob ties on East and West
We gouge out your eye balls if you seen too much
Hopin' out drops wit blings and stuff
Wit ball players wives, Mercedes 5
Dangerous lives and haters die rollin' with convicts
Conscience who tolerate no nonsense
Fake rappers in doo-rags, get shot-up at their concert
Your bitch bleed, bitin' her nipples with my chipped tooth
I drink her blood, like I'm Dracula, mack in the 6-Coupe
The sky becomes red, heard y'all niggaz work with the feds
Doesn't matter, blood'll splatter, everybody must dead
I got urge for self-reinvention, but I'm old-fashioned
From the corner's with the winos laughin'
Dealers and five-o blastin'
Capitalist thoughts like Presidents
I'm burnin' Bush's, Nas the realest, it's nuttin' to f*ck wit

[Chorus: Uncredited Female (Nas)]
You think you know me but I... (Tell 'em Ma)
..Don't think so (Don't think so)
It takes a 'lil more than... (What?, what?)
What do you know about me?
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
About me
(See what you don't know me you'll never will)
(And what you don't know will get yourself killed)
You'll never know

    
I smoke weed like them sixties rebellions, hippies on heroin
Spliffs inhalin', what I speak strictly for felons
Dippin' in their 6-4, hittin' the switches
Or sittin' in their Bentley Azure's, feelin' the riches
Or just ridin', truck drivin' Impalas, Denali's
I f*ck with those but I lust for silver Ferrari's
I f*ck hoes with the ceilings, have mirrors to watch me
My bed shaped like a pyramid, feelin' the dry heat
Spillin' Courvoisi', I'm half slave-master
Half Apache, half African, much is what I call us Black men
Lead astray, drugs and cups of alcohol, 'cause back when
They let us off ships; the soul of man was lost or trapped in
But every ghetto, every hood, no matter where the town
It's all haunted, all on   slave burial grounds
Dead cooks, workers and maids, under this Earth in rage
Ancient whore houses that explain my sexual ways
Money and murder: interprets the American dream
The world loves a gangsta, I found my place in this thing
Royce's, diamonds and bosses, woman who're gorgeous
Traitors, killers and enemies, remorseless, we live this

[Chorus: Uncredited Female (Nas)]

    
Gypsies, preachers, choirs, churches, liquor stores
The world is full of liars, curses, people rich or poor
Without God to worship, see we would be more lost
Gotta believe in somethin', or their would be no laws
A ghetto child occasionally blunted in Mansions
My cup overflow with Cristal, hundred exotic dancers
Niggaz is plastic, ass gets jealous and passive
My pistol blast at; cowards, leechers, and rappers
Niggaz I f*ck with is 'Bravehearts', make G's
Before rap music to me, was wind blowin' the trees
Birds chirpin', rain fallin', perfect and free
But bitches saw my video and think they know me
These niggaz bad talkin', claimin' they gon' do me
Stay out my path homey, you f*ckin' wit a true G
Bitch "You Don't Know Me"

[Chorus: Uncredited Female (Nas)]





Uh, you know I still run with that, that blood of a slave
Boiling in my veins
It's just hot until a nigga can't take it no more
Blood of a slave, Heart of a King
Turn my voice up

Ayo, the brother is "Stillmatic"
I crawled up out of that grave, wiping the dirt, cleaning my shirt
They thought I'll make another "Illmatic"
But it's always forward I'm moving
Never backwards stupid here's another classic
C-Notes is falling from the sky
By now the credits roll starring Nas executive poet, produced, directed by
The Kid slash Escobar
Narration describes the lives and laws tribes in the ghetto trying to survive
The feature opens with this young black child
Finger scratch, cigarette burns on the sofa, turning the TV down
Mary Jane girls, 45's playing, soft in the background
Poof from C-Town's mornings was hash browns
Stepped over dope fiends, walking out the door, all of us paw
I learned the difference between the snitches, the real ones, and who's soft
And the murderous, hungriest crews
People jumping from roofs, shotguns pumping made it through my youth
Walking very thin lines, ages seven and nine
That's the age I was on my album cover, this is the rebirth
I know the streets thirst water like Moses
Walking through the hot desert searching to be free
This is my end and my new beginning Nostalgia
Out for the in a mega places, it's like a glitch in the matrix
I seen it at all, did it all, most of y'all been pop for a minute
Spitters, sinners and the game get rid of y'all
Y'all got there but y'all didn't get it all, I want my style back
Hate to cease y'all plan it's the rap reaper man
To them double up hustlers, bidders, niggaz who real
Professionals, stick up childs dreaming for meals
Let my words guide you, get inside you
From crypts to pirals this is survival

Blood of a Slave, Heart of a King
Blood of a Slave, Heart of a King
Uh, uh Blood of a Slave, Heart of a King
Uh, yea
Huh, Braveheart




[gunshots]

[Nas talking]
("F*ck Jay-Z")
What's up niggas, ay yo, I know you ain't talkin 'bout me dog
You, what?
("F*ck Jay-Z")
You been on my dick nigga, you love my style, nigga
("F*ck Jay-Z")


(I) F*ck with your soul like ether
(Will) Teach you the king you know you
(Not) "God's son" across the belly
(Lose) I prove you lost already

Brace yourself for the main event
Y'all impatiently waitin
It's like an AIDS test, what's the results?
Not positive, who's the best? Pac, Nas and Big
Ain't no best, East, West, North, South, flossed out, greedy
I embrace y'all with napalm
Blows up, no guts, left chest, face gone
How could Nas be garbage?
Semi-autos at your cartilege
Burner at the side of your dome, come outta my throne
I got this, locked since '9-1
I am the truest, name a rapper that I ain't influenced
Gave y'all chapters but now I keep my eyes on the Judas
With Hawaiin Sophie fame, kept my name in his music
Check it



[talking]
Ay yo, pass me the weed, pour my ashes out on these niggas man (no doubt)
Ay, y'all faggots, y'all kneel and kiss the f*ckin ring



I've been f*cked over, left for dead, dissed and fogotten
Luck ran out, they hoped that I'd be gone, stiff and rotten
Y'all just piss on me, shit on me, spit on my grave (uh)
Talk about me, laugh behind my back but in my face
Y'all some "well wishers," friendly actin, envy hidin snakes
With your hands out for my money, man, how much can I take?
When these streets keep callin, heard it when I was sleep
That this Gay-Z and Cockafella Records wanted beef
Started cockin up my weapon, slowly loadin up this ammo
To explode it on a camel, and his soldiers, I can handle
This for dolo and it's manuscript, just sound stupid
When KRS already made an album called Blueprint
First, Biggie's ya man, then you got the nerve to say that you better than Big
Dick suckin lips, whyn't you let the late, great veteran live

[talking]
(I...will...not...lose)
"God's son" across the belly, I prove you lost already
The king is back, where my crown at?
(Ill...will) Ill Will rest in peace, let's do it niggas



Y'all niggas deal with emotions like bitches
What's sad is I love you 'cause you're my brother
You traded your soul for riches
My child, I've watched you grow up to be famous
And now I smile like a proud dad, watchin his only son that made it
You seem to be only concerned with dissin women
Were you abused as a child, scared to smile, they called you ugly?
Well life is hard, hug me, don't reject me
Or make records to disrespect me, blatent or indirectly
In '88 you was gettin chased through your buildin
Callin my crib and I ain't even give you my numbers
All I did was gave you a style for you to run with
Smilin in my face, glad to break bread with the god
Wearin Jaz chains, no tecs, no cash, no cars
No jail bars Jigga, no pies, no case
Just Hawaiian shirts, hangin with little Chase
You a fan, a phony, a fake, a pussy, a Stan
I still whip your ass, you thirty-six in a karate class
You Tae-bo hoe, tryna' work it out, you tryna' get brolic?
Ask me if I'm tryna' kick knowledge
Nah, I'm tryna' kick the shit you need to learn though
That ether, that shit that make your soul burn slow
Is he Dame Diddy, Dame Daddy or Dame Dummy?
Oh, I get it, you Biggie and he's Puffy
Rockafeller died of AIDS, that was the end of his chapter
And that's the guy y'all chose to name your company after?
Put it together, I rock hoes, y'all rock fellas
And now y'all try to take my spot, fellas?
Philly's hot rock fellas, put you in a dry spot, fellas
In a pine box with nine shots from my glock, fellas
Foxy got you hot 'cause you kept your face in her puss
What you think, you gettin girls now 'cause of your looks?
Ne-gro please
You no mustache havin, with whiskers like a rat
Compared to Beans you wack
And your man stabbed Un and made you take the blame
You ass, went from Jaz to hangin with Caine, to Herb, to Big
And, Eminem murdered you on your own shit
You a dick-ridin faggot, you love the attention
Queens niggas run you niggas, ask Russell Simmons
Ha, R-O-C get gunned up and clapped quick
J.J. Evans get gunned up and clapped quick
Your whole damn record label gunned up and clapped quick
Shawn Carter to Jay-Z, damn you on Jaz dick
So little shorty's gettin gunned up and clapped quick
How much of Biggie's rhymes is gon' come out your fat lips?
Wanted to be on every last one of my classics
You pop shit, apologize, nigga, just ask Kiss







[sample singing]
"Woke up this mornin', you got yourself a gun, you got yourself a gun"..


Yo I'm livin' in this time behind enemy lines
so I got mine, I hope you ("got yourself a gun")
You from the hood, I hope you ("got yourself a gun"
you want beef I hope ya ("got yourself a gun")
And when I see you I'ma take what I want
so you tried to front, hope ya ("got yourself a gun")
You ain't real, hope ya ("got yourself a gun")


My first album had no famous guest appearances
the outcome, I'm was crowned the best lyricist
many years on this professional level
why would you question who's better?
the World is still mine, tattoos real
with "God's Son" across the belly, the boss of rap
you saw me in Belly with thoughts like that
to take it back to Africa, I did it with Biggie
Me and 2Pac were soldiers of the same struggle
You lames should huddle, your teams shook y'all feel
the wrath of a killer, 'cause this is my football field 
Throwin' passes from a barrel, shoulder pads, apparel
but the Q.B. don't stand for no quarterback
every word is like a sawed-off blast
'cause y'all all soft and I'm the black hearse
that came to haul y'all ass in
it's for the hood by the corner store
many try, many die, come at Nas if you want a war.




I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
and If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
you know the kid got his chipped tooth fixed
Hair parted with a barbers preciseness
Bravehearted for life, it's - 
the return of the Golden Child, son of a blues player
so who are you playa? y'all awaited the true savior
puffin' that tropical, cups of that Vodka too
Papi chu', tore up, wake up in a hospital
Throw up? never, 'member I do this through righteous steps
you Judists thought I was gone, so in light of my death
y'all been all happy go lucky, bunch of sambos
call me Gods Son, with my pants low
I don't die slow, put them rags up like Petey Pablo
this is Nasdaq dough, in my Nascar with this Nas flow, reppin'
hit the record sto', never let me go, get my whole collection.




It's - the - return of the Prince, the boss
this is real hardcore, Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit's soft
sip criss, get chips, wrist gliss, I floss
stick shift look sick up in that boxsta Porsche
with the   cut off, rich kids go and cop the source
they don't know about the blocks I'm on
and everybody wanna know where the kid live, where he rest at?
where he shop at and dress at?
know he got dough, where does he live?
is he still in the bridge?
does he really know how ill that he is?
got all of y'all watchin' my moves
my watch and my jewels
hop in my coupe, dodge interviews like that
It's not only my jewels, ice anything, plenty chains
Look at my tennis shoes, I iced that
Who am I? the back twister, lingerie ripper
automatic leg spreader, quicker brain getter
keepin' it gangsta wit' ya








Smokin' Lyrics





Bis-Mi-Allah A-Rahman A-Rahim
(To the Gods.. to the Gods.. to the Earths)
Pass that shit homey

[Intro/Chorus]
Now tell me what y'all smokin
What kinda heat y'll holdin
Well is your creep move potent
I got a bunch of bullets and a bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggaz c'mon
We bi-coastin, keepin our po-ckets bulgin
We got the plan in motion
I got a bunch of bullets and a bag of guns I pass 'em to my niggaz c'mon

[Verse One]
Zoom, from outer space he comes
Blunt in his mouth with his hand on his gun
Bitches flappin they gums, do he be clappin and shootin guys
Actor or a movie star, rapper revolutionized
What is his race nation or creed?
Is he arabic, black, latin, asian they read
Magazines say I walked on water, talked to the heavens
Spit at judges, stepped on peasants
But in reality, I just entered your galaxy
September '73, up in these wild streets
F*ckin these wild freaks, a harem of hoes (God damn)
And my mystique got 'em tearin my clothes



[Verse Two]
My nigga smoke with one lung
If he cough he might die, passin me trees
The liquor bottle's almost empty
We about to collide, with the enemy
Only way you die if it's meant to be
You f*ckin with a general
No discussion is the principle we bustin it's the end of you
Now we knockin on your mama door
Like we cam to fix the sink; my kind of war
Death, angels comin for you
Spirit horse runnin from your body like Young Guns 1 and 2
Paramedics fightin for you, who's gon' win?
The hands of time, or the hands of medicine
Don't cry, witness your fate, this is your wake
Walk by your casket, spit in your face
Enter the fog dog, the light is your guide
And when you're gone all your niggaz gon' light it with Nas



[Verse Three]
Pardon but I gotta question of life now
Look at the nigga next to you right now
Is he real, fake or scared
Do it like this niggaz right hands in the air
Ball it to a fist and put it over your heart
Now let's say it all together let the ceremony start
I shall - stay real stay true stay holdin figures
Never put a bitch over my niggaz
I shall never, cooperate with the law
Never snake me I always hold you down in war
If they take one of mine, I take one of theirs
I never break the oath to the death I swear
I swear that's how we pledge alegiance, to the alliance
of underworld's killers and thugs, though the science 
of a nigga still yet to be found
So light up some green, and pass it around (just pass it around)



[repeat until fade]
Wanna get high, come smoke with me 
Smoke with me, light it up







Uh uh, yo
They plan was to knock me out the   of the game
But I overstand they truth is all lame
I hold cannons that shoot balls of flames
Right in they fat mouth then I carve my name
Nas - too real, Nas - true king
It's however you feel, g'head, you swing
Your arms too short to box with god
I don't kill soloists only kill squads
Fame went to they head, so now it's "F*ck Nas"
Yesterday you begged for a deal, today you tough guys
I seen it comin
Soon as I popped my first bottle I spotted my enemies tryna' do what I do
Came in with my style, so I fathered you
I kept changin on the world since "...Barbeque"
Now you wanna hang with niggas I hung with
F*ck bitches I hit, it's funny I once said...
If I, ever make a record
I take a check and put something away for a rainy day to make my exit
But look at me now, ten years deep
Since the project, ??
I never asked to be   of rap's elite
Just a ghetto child tryna' learn the traps of the streets
But look at me now


"You're the man" "You're the man"
"You're the man" "You're the man"
"You're the man" "You're the man"
"You're the man" "You're the man"
"You're the man" "You're the man"

But wait a sec', give me time to explain, women and fast cars
And diamond rings can poison a rap star
It's suicidal, how I smoke in so much la'
I saw a dead bird flyin through a broken sky
Wish I could flap wings and fly away
To where black kings and Ghana stay 
So I could get on my flesh right away
But that'll be the day when it's peace
When my gat don't need to spray
When these streets are safe to play
Sex with death, indulge in these women
Vision my own skeleton swimmin in eternal fire
Broads play with pentagrams in they vagina
Like the Exorcist, then they gave birth to my seeds
I beg for God's help, why they love hurtin me?
I'm your disciple, a thug certainly
I'm the N the A to the S-I-R
If I wasn't I must've been Escobar
Forty-five in my waist, starin at my reflection
In the mirror, sittin still in the chair like my conception
When everything around me got cloudy, the chair became a king's throne
My destiny found me
It was clear why the struggle was so painful
Metamorphosis, this is what I changed to
And God, I'm so thankful





Listen up gangstas and honeys with ya hair done
Pull up a chair hon' and put it in the air son
Dog, whatever they call you, god, just listen
I spit a story backwards, it starts at the ending

The bullet goes back in the gun
The bullet hole's closin this chest of a nigga
Now he back to square one
Screamin, "Shoot don't please"
I put my fifth back on my hip
It's like a VCR rewindin a hit
He put his hands back on his bitch
My caravan doors open up
I jumped back in the van and closed it shut
Goin reverse, slowly prepared
My nigga Jungle utters out somethin crazy like, "Go he there"
Sittin in back of this chair, we hittin the roach
The smoke goes back in the blunt, the blunt gets bigger in growth
Jungle unrolls it, put his weed back in the jar
The blunt turns back into a cigar
We listen to Stevie, it sounded like heavy metal fans
Spinnin records backwards of AC/DC
I give my niggas dap, jump out the van back first
Back upstairs, took off the black shirt
I'm in the crib with the phone to my ear
Listen up so y'all can figure out the poem real clear
The voice on the phone was like, "Outside right we"
So with my mouth wide, holdin my heat
Bullets I had plenty to squeeze, plenty for ya
'Cause Jungle said, "Block your on enemies the"
Hung up the phone, then the phone rang 
I'm laid in the bed thinkin 'bout this pretty young thing
Who left, she came back, her clothes just fell to the rug
She fell to my bed and gave me a hug
I told her, "No hell"
She talkin 'bout, "Me kiss"
Bobbed her head then spit the nut back in my dick
Started suckin with no hands, a whole lotta spit
Then got up and put her bra back on her tits
Got fully dressed and told me, "Stressed really I'm"
Picked up her Gucci bag and left her nigga behind
Walkin through the door, she rang the bell twice
I vomited Vodka back in my glass with juice and ice
The clock went back from three, to two, to one
And that's about the time the story begun
That's when I first heard the voicemail on the cell
It said, "Son we found that nigga we gotta kill"
[Message Beep]
Ay yo son, ay yo son, you hear me, you hear me?
Listen man, this dude right on the block, right now, man
I found him, right now, I see him right now!
Let's kill him)
[Message Beep]
"Yo, this Nas, leave it.    Peace"




[speaking softly, gradually getting louder]
One time.. yeah.. yeah..

Yo, all I need is one mic, one beat, one stage
One nigga front, my face on the front page
Only if I had one gun, one girl and one crib
One God to show me how to do things his son did
Pure, like a cup of virgin blood; mixed with
151, one sip'll make a nigga flip
Writin names on my hollow tips, plottin shit
Mad violence who I'm gon' body, this hood politics
Ackowledge it, leave bodies chopped in garbages
Seeds watch us, grow up and try to follow us
Police watch us {*siren*} roll up and try knockin us
One knee I ducked, could it be my time is up
But my luck, I got up, the cop shot again
Bus s  glass bursts, a fiend drops his Heineken
Richochetin between the spots that I'm hidin in
Blackin out as I shoot back, f*ck gettin hit! [more sirens]
This is my hood I'ma rep, to the death of it
'til everybody come home, little niggaz is grown
Hoodrats, don't abortion your womb, we need more warriors soon
Sip from the star sun and the moon
In this life of police chases street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin victims with doctors
IF YOU REALLY THINK YOU READY TO DIE, WITH NINES OUT
THIS IS WHAT NAS IS BOUT, NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!

[whispering again]
Yo, all I need is one mic..
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. all I need niggaz
All I need is one mic.. yeah

[gradually getting louder]
All I need is one blunt, one page, and one pen
One prayer - tell God forgive for one sin
Matter fact maybe more than one, look back
at all the hatred against me, f*ck alla them
Jesus died at age 33, there's thirty-three shots
from twin glocks there's sixteen apiece, that's thirty-two
Which means, one of my guns was holdin 17
Twenty-seven hit your crew, six went into you
Everybody gotta die sometime; hope your funeral
never gets shot up, bullets tear through the innocent
Nothin is fair, niggaz roll up, shootin from wheelchairs
My heart is racin, tastin revenge in the air
I let the shit slide for too many years, too many times
Now I'm strapped with a couple of macs, too many nines
If y'all niggaz really wit me get busy load up the semis
Do more than just hold it explode the clip until you empty
There's nothin in our way - they bust, we bust, they rust, we rust
Led flyin, feel it?    I feel it in my gut
THAT WE TAKE THESE BITCHES TO WAR, LIE 'EM DOWN
CAUSE WE STRONGER NOW MY NIGGA THE TIME IS NOW!!

[whispering again]
All I need is one mic.. that's all I need, that's all I need
All I need is one mic.. there's nuttin else in the world
All I need is one mic.. that's all a nigga need to do his thing y'know
All I need is one mic..

[starting loud this time, getting quieter]
ALL I NEED IS ONE LIFE, ONE TRY, ONE BREATH I'M ONE MAN
WHAT I STAND FOR SPEAKS FOR ITSELF, THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND
Or wanna see me on  , too egotistical
Talkin all that slick shit, the same way these bitches do
Wonder what my secrets is, niggaz'll move on you
only if they know, what your weakness is I have none
Too late to grab guns I'm blastin cause I'm a cool nigga
Thought I wouldn't have that ass done?    Fooled you niggaz
What you call a infinite brawl, eternal souls clashin
War gets deep, some beef is everlastin
Complete with thick scars, brothers knifin each other
up in prison yards, drama, where does it start?
You know the block was ill as a youngster
Every night it was like a, cop would get killed body found in the dumpster
For real a hustler, purchased my Range, niggaz throwin dirt on my name
Jealous cause fiends got they work and complain
Bitches left me cause they thought I was finished
Shoulda knew she wasn't true she came to me when her man caught a sentence
Diamonds are blindin, I never make the same mistakes
Movin with a change of pace, lighter load, see now the king is straight
Swellin my melon cause none of these niggaz real
Heard he was, tellin police, how can a kingpin squeal?
This is crazy, I'm on the right track I'm finally found
You need some soul searchin, the time is now

All I need is one mic.. yeah, yeah yeah yeah
All I need is one mic.. that's all I ever needed in this world, f*ck cash
All I need is one mic.. f*ck the cars, the jewelry
All I need is one mic.. to spread my voice to the whole world





   , hahaha

"Cause when I flow the for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"Nas.."

 
Yo
Explode, my thoughts were drunken from quarts of beers
Was years back, before Nasir would explore a career in rap
As a music dude, I mastered this Rubik's Cube
Godzilla, fought Gargantua, eyes glued to the tube
Was a, long time ago, John Boy Ice
Geronimo po-lice jumpin out Chryslers, easywider paper
Pops puffin his sess, punchin his chest like a gorilla
Outside was psychoes, killers
Saw Divine, Goon and Chungo, Lil' Turkey
R.I.P. Tyrone, 'member no cursin front of Ms. Vercey
Big Percy, Crazy Paul, the Sledge Sisters
My building was 40-16, once in the blue, hallways was clean
I knew, all that I'd seen had meant somethin
Learned early, to fear none little Nas was huntin
Livin carefree laughin, got jokes on the daily
Y'all actin like some old folks y'all don't hear me
Yo I'm in my second childhood

[Chorus: repeat 2X]
"Cause when I flow the for the street.." - ".. who else could it be"
"N-A-S" - "Nas.."
"Resurrect, through the birth of my seed.." - "Queensbridge"
"Make everything right.." - "Get yours, nigga"

 
Yo, dude is 31, livin in his moms crib
Ex-convict, was paroled there after his long bid
Cornrows in his hair, still slingin, got a crew
They break his moms furniture, watchin Comicview
Got babies by different ladies high smokin L's
in the same spot he stood since, eighty-five well
When his stash slow, he be crazy
Say he by his moms, hit her on her payday
Junior high school dropout, teachers never cared
They was paid just to show up and leave, no one succeeds
So he moves with his peers, different blocks, different years
Sittin on, different benches like it's musical chairs
All his peoples moved on in life, he's on the corners at night
with young dudes it's them he wanna be like
It's sad but it's fun to him right?    He never grew up
31 and can't give his youth, he's in his second childhood



 
Baby girl she's always talkin name droppin hangin late
Drinkin smokin hates her baby daddy, craves shoppin
E poppin Ecstasy takin, won't finish her education
Best friend she keeps changin, stuck with limitations
Lustin men, many hotels, Fendi Chanel
With nothin in her bank account frontin she do well
Her kid suffers he don't get that love he deserve
He the Sun, she the Earth, single mom, even worse
No job never stay workin, mad purty
Shorty they call her the brain surgeon
Time flyin she the same person, never matures
All her friends married doin well
She's in the streets yakkety yakkin like she was 12
Honey is twenty-seven, argues fights
Selfish in her own right, polite, guess she's in her second childhood



"Who else could it be.." - "N-A-S" - "Nas.."








This is a journey into the worlds most largest
And notorious projects, Queensbridge
Listen while Nas saves his hood from the most
Cowardest rappers

 
He held a mass appeal and a little boy smile
Depressed has a complex his mouth was foul
You need to stay around I feel like telling some stories
First theres this arrogent f*ck, his names Cory
Hung around my mans Like and Big Trevor
Trevors still locked up, Likes getting his cheddar
Cory changed his name to arr, whatever
Cornchip, Buckwheat lookalike, its Mega
Right Mega was his name sorry about that
But its so hard to put a cowards name in my rap
Always acting tough, a jokester be fronting
He got snuffed, he got shot in the thigh, he did nothing
But thats Nas always looking out for breadrin
Cause when brethren don't return love it don't stress him
Cause gangstas do gangsta shit, real recognize real
Still laughing to the bank and shit
Back to Cor, got him a deal but his rhymes was whack
Def Jam mad that he signed the contract
Now he got jealous and mad at my shine
Making silly tapes, I'm always on his mind
Nonsense, not to be obnoxious kid
Mega for the record you could suck my dick
Bitch you from around the way its sad what this do to me
But Queensbridge, we gotta have unity

[Chorus x2]
They say the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah this is a time we destroy and rebuild it
They say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over
Nah we the strongest hood but weak niggas kill it
So they say, the bridge is over, the bridge is over

 
Since we on the subject of traders and flunkies
Mega aint the only faggot in my hood dummies
Theres plenty that wanna be me but cannot
Its like King Arther and Knight Sir Lance-A-Lot
Lefty and Donnie Brasco, Gotti and Paul
Before I woulda told you Prodigy's my dog
Through the ups and downs, robberies and all
Though I always knew he wanted my downfall
He would say his little slick shit and act real funny
For what nigga you're butt and it got back to me
Asking a Braveheart to get back your jewelry
You aint from my hood, don't even rep Q.B.
Nature moved to Marcy
Man dick riding Nature, nothing else to say
Man Nature moved to Marcy
Back with ass niggas in fear
F*ck them niggas go head with the progam man proceed
Old lady pocketbook snatcher, car thief
Of course we aint friends, you never stood on no blocks
Streets or corners with zombies, ghouls and gangstas
Cops, drug dealers with pools of blood anger
Just fills me when niggas let out of town to set shot
And get filthy rich, its just not
No more morals, no loyalty, no more community
Queensbridge, we gotta have unity



 
I put the name on the map after Marly and Shan
Q.B. before the ROC had one jam
Before the Death Row and Bad Boy beef
Had streets locked with raw talent, I laugh at the weak
So this about cleaning up house, my own backyard
Famous home of rap stars well known be getting robbed
P how many times aint you shamed that
Jungle was busting his gun to get your weak chain back
They dont respect you a checks due for me for your fame
Mega I hope you blow so I'm saying your name (Mega, Mega)
Hoes play your position cause you'll never be king
Even Jigga want the crown, ?? poor thing
I'm representing Queensbridge U.S.A.
Where two sk's go off every day new flesh lay
All you little roaches and rats 
Besides my man Ricky, Nas the true ruler is back
So haters say



[Talking]
The bridge is over my dick, Bridge'll never be over
Long as I'm alive and breathing, Braveheart to the graveyard
I'm the William Wallace of this shit
Ayo P, Prodigy I got love for you man, I love you man
You know what I'm saying, just get them unloyal niggas
From out your circle, you can't save everybody
Niggas invited you to the hood, rep it right my nigga
Be untouchable my nigga, so it be Mobb for life for real
And thats real, ayo Nature I can't hold your hand through this shit man
I'm not your father man, be your own man, stand on your own two
I believe in you, believe in yourself nigga or dont even rep this
Ayo Mega you wanna be a gangsta?    Theres real gangsta
Shit going on in the streets man, yo niggas is in the grind
Where you be at man?    Niggas be bucking
Why you never bucking, where you be at man?
All of a sudden you the motherf*ckin Neo Brown of the f*cking hood
Its disgusting man, stay out the magazines
Keep my name out your motherf*cking mouth
Theres no more room for jealousy, we destroying and rebuilding
That means the cowards get out and the real niggas stay
Niggas been hating me since I been nine, shining
with suede motherf*cking balles on in silks
I'ma always be the young don, dont be like the niggas on the other side
Hating me cause I'm beautiful, real niggas in Queensbridge
You niggas come up and get this money and move on baby
Q.B.


   
[AZV] Peace king
    king
[AZV] Listen, they wrote a book on your life
   
[AZV] You think anybody'll read it?
  No f*  doubt!
[AZV] Let's make history homey
    then
[AZV] You know we brought the hoes clothes and money rolls to the table
[Nas - laughing] No, f*ckin, doubt
[AZV] It's time to manifest this
    we the flyest nigga
[AZV] Bring it to a whole, y'know?
    nigga


Niggaz better watch ya back, it's so cold
Pinky rings shinin, so act like y'don't know
Bitches in heat for niggaz that got dough
We the flyest gangsters
What you don't got is my natural glow
Countin out stacks and mackin out hoes
Pushin big dicks and packin our chrome
We the flyest gangsters

[AZ]
Follow, I'm like a Lamborghini green Diablo
Coupe VT, it's like DVD when I flow
Feel me, I'm loved like the great late Malik Sealy
The one the player haters hate dearly, but can't near me
Homicide can't scare me
I o-bide by the laws of these streets sincerely, a real nigga
The type that can build with ya
Verbalize bring life to a still picture, it's God-given
Been blessed with Allah's vision, strength and beauty
Truly my only duty is to dodge prison
Play wit me, I'm modest 'til them strays hit me
Regardless the circumstances I'ma stay filthy
Dough forever, the live stay low forever
And f*ck niggaz, cause it's hard to keep them close together
One dependant, no wife, one co-defendant
No forms of weakness, I flow with vengeance



 
I do what I can do when I can do it
Feel how I feel when I feel what I'm feelin
Live how I live it's only cause I been through it
Learn to try it like to eat it and shit it's nuttin to it
Burn it light it weed it and off the liquor, while drivin outside
I'll never catch a vehicular homicide
My music is a description of my vibe of course
My life, my sites, my thoughts, what I like on my fork
Cause you are what you eat, you eat what you can
You pray to bless the food but first you wash your hands
to wash away them bad spirits, don't bring it in your home
Once you let them in they stayin, evil be gone, say it
I'm proud of Mase for givin himself to the Lord
Wanted his Faith, think about Big anymore
Of course my nigga Horse got married, see shit is changin
We ain't these little niggaz no more, runnin dangerous
I like to bone, I'm a peaceful brother
Eat up so much the girls call me seafood lover
Be havin they legs shakin, stab 'em, break 'em
I'm Hercules Hercules when havin relations, the flyest



  We put   on the, soul of our born
[AZV] As we hold the Qu'ran
    style
[AZV] Older cats coachin us on
  Yo   kill or be killed
[AZV] Understand, real'll be real
  A  -shot spectrum MAKE YOUR WHOLE EMBASSY KNEEL
[AZV] Identity sealed, protected by
  our   shield
[AZV] And f*ck a drop, cause that's that shit that got Kennedy killed
    the books
[AZV] Was taught never expose a crook
    the knight and the bishop
[AZV] Wanna knock ya rook; I'm a rare breed never had a fair to lead
  I   light niggaz recite
[AZV] Too impaired to breathe
  WE   HARD HIT JUST LIKE CAMACHO AND VARGAS, WHO'S THE TARGET?
  Now   how we close the market, motherf*ckers

[Chorus - repeat 2X]







[Intro (Nas)]
Yeah... ay yo Jungle... ay yo Wiz...
Come on man... Let's do this
It's a Braveheart party y'all
C'mon

[Chorus (Mary)]
Throw your hands up cuz we wanna dance
Don't be afraid just take a chance
Cuz this beat will rock your body
Get up on the floor and party
Now y'all tell me what y'all wanna do
Thinkin' while I have a drink or two
Throw your hands up everybody
Get up on the floor and party

[Verse 1 (Nas)]
I move at night, respect my gangsta
Ready for whatever you bring, the mood is right
The club is righteous, tight with family
Squeezin on big old bubbles with no panties
Ladies who's sexually free
And once in a while live on the wild side, kinky & nasty
Middle fingers up and say "F*ck the world"
Throw your hands up, they can't f*ck with you girl
And my fellas, two time felons, two nine tote and lethal
Quick to leave you wide open, if you gettin' tore down
Blowin' a blunt cloud, and the DJ's makin' you feel thugged out
Put yo hands up

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2 (Jungle)]
I pull in a V12 drop all red
Look at ma with that cat paw tat on'er leg
Come here girl can I kiss you, let me lick you
Show you what your body made for, you're official
You could be my baby mama lookin like that
What you drink, champagne or Cognac
What you like dancin diamonds, Dolce Gabbana
Fendi, Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Prada
A nigga like Jungle to always come thru
Shine in yo hood whenever the f*ck you want to
Cause I'ma B.R.A.V., E.H.E.A.R.T. from QB
Put'em up...

[Repeat Chorus]

Party all night (Party all night)
Let's drink, no fights (Let's drink, no fights)
Party all night (Whachu wan' do?)
Let's drink, no fights (Drink up...c'mon, yeah, yeah...)

[Verse 3 (Wiz)]
I'm blaze, haze for days
Blackout thinkin' of ways to get paid
Mac out corner I got it's all laid
Shorty, with a nice round ass in my face
Now do she want me to touch her?
Or do she want me to see?
F*ck is she comin wit me
A true BHG Wiz, not complex
Chin checks if it get hectic
Nigga Braveheart respected
Get bent at the bar, talk shit, walk it
And if I can't talk it, the false big cop a case
I'm here to blaze, roll up a dutch and take it to the face
Throw yo hands up




[talking]
Yeah, yeah, yeah yeah, Nas, uh, yo, yo
Life, they wonder, can they take me under?
Nah, never that, nah, yo, yo

I come from the housin tenement buildings
Unlimited killings, menaces marked for death
Better known as the projects where junkies and rock heads dwell
Though I owe to it my success
With survival of the fittest, everyday is a chal'
I would think I'm a part of U.S.A. and be proud
Confronted with racism, started to feel foreign
Like, the darker you are the realer your problems
I reached for the stars but I just kept slippin
On this life mission, never know what's next
Ancient kings from Egypt, up to Julius Caeser
Had a piece of the globe, every continent
Yo, there's Asia, Africa, Europe, France, Japan
Pakistan, America, Afghanstan
Yo, there's Protestants, Jews, Blacks, Arabics
Call a truce, world peace, s  actin like savages
No war, we should take time and think
The bombs and tanks makes mankind extinct
But since the beginning of time it's been men with arms fightin
Lost lives in the Towers and Pentagon, why then?
Must it go on, we must s  the killin
Tell me why we die, we all God's children

[Chorus - Amerie, Nas in background]
All this hate can't last forever (uh, c'mon)
It's time that we stand together (yeah, for the world)
Everybody wants to rule the world (what, what, what, what, what, c'mon)
World (peace), world (peace), world (peace), world

Yo, there's brothers on the block, posted up like they own it
That's they corner, from New York to California
Got blocks locked down
Like, "dog you safe whenever you with me, see this is my town"
So the youngsters, grows in ghettos, goes to prison
At an early age, already know it's against him
So in order for him to survive, one day he must
Open up his eyes to the set backs and rise
'Cause, everybody wants a shot, in this land of opportunity
Look at what this country's got
There shouldn't be nobody homeless
How can the president fix other problems when he ain't fixed home yet
The earth wasn't made for one man to rule alone
To all colors increases, to home it belongs
I want land, mansions, banks and gold
The diamonds in Africa, oil in my control
The world's natural resources, all its residuals
But then comes foes, I have to gaurd it with missels
And I become the most wanted
But is it worth hearin a million people problems and followed by Secret Service
I guess, attempts at my life with loaded barrels
So move over Colin Powell or just throw in the towel, yo



Y'all know that's my style, to hit you at the right time
No other compares to what Nas write down
Tell you my dreams, show you my pain is yours
You could get what you love, be a chain in cause
You alive right now
There's so many that's dead or locked up inside the beast, I'm a hot light now
It's whatever man think of manifest to the real
The plan is to wake up 'cause time reveals
All this hate can't forever last
All my ghetto heroes in Heaven, it's like you right here and never passed
You just transcend, I know I'm gon' see you again
Hopin I reach the world leaders and win
Ain't nothin without struggle, listen up, it's critical
We used to fear arms, now the weapons are chemical
In Hip-Hop, the weapons are lyrical
To be the best you challenge the best, then the blessings are spiritual
  of the world for the kid and unless
Poppin any rapper's head off his shoulders no contest
I know the Most High hear me, so fly you can't near me
You scared of a mirror, my theory is that - knowledge is power
To every projects and every street corner, we gotta get ours now



[talking]
Yo, niggas ain't forget shit, know what I'm sayin?
Niggas ain't forget nothin
Men, women and children killed by the police and shit
Niggas ain't gon' forget that, you know what I mean?
Yo, what this war just show me is like, whatever you want out of life
Whatever you feel is rightfully yours, go out and take it
Even if that means blood and death
You know, that's what I was raised up on, that's what this country's about
This is what my country is, and my country's a muthaf*cka







American born, American raised, American made

[Chorus 2X]
My country shitted on me (My country)
She wants to get rid of me (Naw, never)
Cause the things I seen (We know too much)
Cause the things I seen (We seen too much)

[Verse 1 (Nas)]
It was packed on the Ryker's bus
The tight cuffs is holdin' me shackled
The life of a thug caught in the devil's lap
On the streets I was invincible
Cowards would duck at a glimpse if they knew
What my pistol would do, a f*ckin' killa
Mothers of dope fiend embarrassin' me
All in front of my friends
In the street smile with no teeth
I never knew daddy, heard he had a 72 caddy
Died in a robbery, can't remember him, was probably 3
Why didn't my folks just die in this society
Why wasn't I a child of a doctor, who left stocks for me
Two little brothers, two sisters, them shortiez gots to eat
Mother's a junkie, she twisted, so all they got is me
I'm the provider, with goals to do much better than my father
Whether through drugs sold, or holdin' revolvers
Blurry visions of dad holdin' me high
It comes to me slowly, the words he would cry

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 2 (Millenium Thug)]
It is I that step up
Me that don't give a f*ck, you that bold, then it's all over soldier
Hummers and Range's through the desert
F*ck a 20 years, long as we got gas and we got water
Troopers lookin' for manslaughter
I gotta get back, for what they owe
Shoot'em in the back for the get back
Lead through shit bag, hold tie gag
Forget the life had, now we all rebels
Everything burnt down includin' the ghetto
We can see 4 miles the land its major rubble
And debris from the earth as we knew crumble
Yo you could see the sea
And the stars look closer to me
I'm a mad man, this is a real life movie Mad Max
S-K's, AK's max, ABR's spittin' and it ain't a rap
My mommy dearest pray for me hopin' I come back
But yo

[Repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3 (Nas + Millenium Thug)]
Yo, I'm sittin' behind these prison walls
I got this pen and pad wishin' on a visit, God
Brothers is here for homicide and yo, it's some for rape
Some brothers innocent, I pray that I could just escape
How is the war
And yo I'm wishin' I was in your shoes
Holdin' machine guns
Clean fun shootin' ducks with fatigues on
Anywhere is better than this
It's America's plan every color of man inherits the shit
Yo I'm startin to think it's all a scheme, nobody cares
I know the warden is readin' the scribe
[MT] But yo I swear, it's a billion dollar business
Courts, lawyers and jails
We all slaves in this business, I'm bout to rebel

[Verse 4 (Millenium Thug)]
There's not a bitch in sight
All block bench, all block gates
All gray fence, look who f*cked it all up, Mr. President
I remember yesterday we was on the block gettin' bent
Now it's state of the art
I just saw the first dude I met here, his head came apart
What a bloody mess, a slug fest
I just buried 8 of mine, at night I hear grown men cryin'
You know I'm spittin' mine
I ain't goin' out here, we gotta win
Everytime I hear the wind I think a slug went in
I'm checkin' my chest, holdin' my head
Catchin' my breath, watchin' my back
Smokin' this grass, beatin' my dick, thinkin' of ass
I don't know what they broadcast, the news hash is fake
Everyday I'm feelin' like you, I wanna escape
And if y'all niggas feelin' like me, y'all niggas just say

[Repeat Chorus]

[Nas talking...]




Ayo its poison, ecstacy, coke
You say its love, it is poison
Schools where I learned they should be burned, it is poison
Physicians prescripting us medicine which is poison
Doctors injecting our infants with the poison
Religion misoverstood is poison


Niggas up in my hood be getting shot giving poison
In hospitals, shots rittle the block
Little children and elderly women run for their lives
Drizzling rain come out the sky every time somebody dies, 
Must be out my f*cking mind, what is this, the hundreth time?
Sending flowers to funerals, reading rest in peace
You know the usual, death comes in threes
Life is short is what some nigga said
Not if you measure life by how one lives and what he did
Its funny how these black killer companies is making money off us
Fast food, colas, sodas skull and bone crossers




Sisters up in my hood trying to do good given choices
When pregnant drop out of school or have abortions
S  working hoping that they find a man that will support them
Up late night on they mothers cordless, thinking a perm or
Bleaching cream will make better when they gorgeous
White girls tanning, lypo suction
Fake titties are implanted, fake lips thats life destruction
Lightskin women, bi-racial hateful toward themselves
Denying even they blood
I don't judge Tiger Woods but I overstand the mental poison
Thats even worser than drugs




Radio and TV poison, white Jesus poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plaow

[Talking]
Never to worry, all the wrong doers got it coming back to em
A thousand times over
Every dog has its day and everything flips around
Even the most greatest nation in the world has it coming back to em
Everyone reaps what they sew that's how it goes
Innocent lives will be taken, it may get worse but we'll get through it
Yall be strong


The China-men built the railroad
The Indians saved the Pilgrim
And in return the Pilgrim killed em
They call it it Thanksgiving, I call your holiday hellday
Cause I'm from poverty, neglected by the wealthy
Me and my niggas share gifts every day like Christmas
Slay bitches and party everyday like this is the last
I'm with my heckles connecting and we hitting the lad
This is my level, f*ck if it get you mad
It's all poison, all of my words to enemies it is poison
Rappers only talk about ki's, its all poison
How could you call yourself emcees you ain't poison
Think about the kids you mislead with the poison
And any thoughts of taking me down is all poison
Who want beef now, my heat shell annoyed them, plaow


What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga
What goes around comes around my nigga
And what goes up it must come down my nigga
The soldiers found below the ground my nigga
Just hold it down we older now my nigga


This nigga Ike with the Iverson jersey
Light skin with herpees
F*ckin' sisters in Harlem, Brooklyn and D.C.
This is the problem cause he never tell em he got it
From letting fags suck him off Rikers Island in nine-three
Drives in Benz, hangs in all the parties
All the concerts, backstage where the stars be
Rocking their shirts in bitches faces like clockwork
Whats your name, where you from, chain blinging
Thinking girls everywheres dumb, taking powder ruining their lives
So they could never have babies, and they could never be wives
He never used a condom, give him head he got ya
Met the wrong bitch and now he dead from the monster AIDs
I contemplate, believing in karma
Those on   could just break and wont be eating tomorrow
I know some bitches who be sleeping on niggas dreams
They leave when they nigga blow she the first bitch on her knees
Knowing dudes thats neglecting their seeds
Instead of taking care of em they spending money on trees
I pray for you deadbeat daddies
Cause when them kids get grown its too late for you
Now you old and you getting shitted on
Its all scientific, mystic, you know the Earth and the stars
Don't hesitate to say you heard it from Nas
What is destined shall be
George Bush killer til George Bush kills me
Much blessings be healthy, remember









Uhh... yeah... uhh...

[Verse 1 (Nas)]
Blessings in life to the children
They say life is like 5 days
Words of a old man with silver hair in his wheel chair
His eyes were bloody while describin' what lies before me
Said evil bitches and jealous men would try to destroy me
It occurred to me, this old nigga's words couldn't be realer
I'm on   now, slightest drama, I'll have ta kill ya
Cuz animals sence weakness, sharks smell blood in water
Ishmael, Moses and Job, moved a divine order
Shit is plastic material, havin' no life
I crash whips and leave it no matter the price
As long as I survive, coppin' the five
Circle the block where the beef's at
And park in front of my enemy's eyes
They see that it's war we life stealers
Hollow tip, lead busters there's no heaven or hell
Dead is dead, f*ckers
And your soul is with God
Your mind keeps lurkin' to earth
Watchin' your own murder reoccur

[Chorus (Repeat 2X)]
For ever struggle, every strip, and every ghetto
For every nigga toned in the pain and heavy metal
For every child that's born
And every nigga gone
And for every brotha breathin'
Live to see another mornin'

[Verse 2 (Blitz)]
It's Blitz nigga the streets glory many die for me
Got knocked refused 3 to 9's, went to trial for me
Basically I'm just reality loaded with vast stories
Of lust, greed, and contempt no street is exempt
Extended clip shots hoods barricaded for 6 blocks
I sip shots, watchin' em hustlers pitch rocks
All you paintin' pictures of my pain
Illustrate the city in vain
Fallin' deep into the pits of the game
This is for the sickest state of mind
In these fatal times, vesh crimes
Nickel play the nine and niggas for the dime
Hear the sounds of them baby's cry
Still I'm sayin' why do we reside
In the ghetto with a million ways to die
Stayin' high to relieve the pain
Breathin' in the game, exhalin'
Guilts and the shame, misery and strain
What the f*ck will tomorrow bring
Look at anthrax, I stand back through
Hopin' I make it tomorrow

[Verse 3 (Nas)]
My skin is a art gallery, right
With paintings of crucifixes
Hopin' to save me from all the dangers in the music business
Was once a young gangsta hangin' with youth offenders
But since I tasted paper it started losin the friendships
Watchin' kids freeze in winters, they still poor
How could I tease them with Benz's and feel no remorse
Drivin' past them in the lively fashion, diamond colors clashin'
Red stones, blue stones, red bones and black ones
F*ck did I expect with bucket seats in a Lex
And spendin' time in Chuckie Cheese with Little Des
Got guns when I'm with my daughter
Hate to bring a violent aura in her presence
She knows what daddy taught her, it's lessons
Black princess it's a ugly world
I put my life up for yours, see I love that girl
Could you believe even my shadow's jealous
My skin is mad at my flesh, my flesh hates my own bones
My brain hates my heart, my heart makes the songs
Though my songs come from the Father
I'm lonely...
Hold me, it's gettin' darker

[Repeat Chorus 2X]




[Rich Nice]
What's happenin brothers and sisters?
Welcome to our time

[Jessica Care Moore]
Afro-Angels hide my weapons in tangles
Black Star Spangled, fragile like hematite with the East oils I write
Despite the lack of sunlight, got my battle boots tight
Now that the government's gone, can't tell your left from your right
Winged assassins laughin while the New World's collapsin
Mother Earth's ribs crashed in, armed with cowries, I'm blastin
As the Earth rebels my womb swells
The birth of Black Magic, savin my people force of habit
You can't find if you ain't never had it
Spiritually crafted black-listed hair-twisted ghetto embargo lifted
Power-shiftin comb-fistin I predict Goddesses you runnin after witches
I kiss my fourteen stitches
Keep all my baby girl wishes
I predict all the oceans turn dry
Not one baby girl will cry as you attempt to grow broccoli from the desert
We will take our pregnant bodies, drink from underground rivers
Wash your face between our legs
While recreating humanity, we will summon yemanja
Search for our fertility, ban all pink and yellow pills
Ban all pink and yellow pills
I predict killing fields of ghetto armpatch anti-Hatch
Hate groups will be bombed
Childbirth becomes outlawed
Always will be branded numbered and logged
All paper money is gone
Confused scholars can interpret our scrolls
Your sky has holes
We know the young is old
Nastradamus tell us how the story gets told






 
To my niggaz.. huh..
We all we got..
Let's hold it down though, y'know?
However it's gon' go down
This what we gotta deal with, y'know?
Yo..

[Chorus: Nas]

It's the life we chose, where friends become foes
and the dough'll get you killed quicker than you know
This is the life we chose, bring fake snakes and hoes
and the only way out, is death or goin broke
This the life we chose, ain't too many happy endings
That's why there ain't too many happy niggaz in it
And I'll admit it, this life is f*cked up but yo..
(but yo..) this life is the only life I know [echoes]

 
Uhh, uhh, uhh
Gold bathtubs, makin love to my Queen
Get my back rubbed, Chardonnay, rollin up green
Statues, marble floors, rare paintings on my wall
My lifestyle's like the Forbes Magazine
Closets, full of rockets and submachines
Take this nigga out the projects, and his thug team
Yo we cruise past street lights, ill rides
Mr. Child both coasts with the most loud toast
Calicos roast y'all folks, keep y'all dyin
Cause it's hard to f*ck around when we dealin with science
My enemies got money, so y'all should watch how I play it
They never know we enemies until they hear me say it
Til they kid's on the phone sayin, "Please daddy pay it"
Til they brain's on the floor, mixed on the pavement
High-class elegance, you respect or you hiss
You go against you'd rather piss on an electrical fence
It's strategic, how these niggaz want you to think
You'd be surprised, who'd be the one to put you to sleep
Why you stink?    Yo these streets don't allow you to blink
You get showered by lead, comin out with your mink
Bow ties and tuxedos, bust Eagles
Dump drugs and acid, then they rush with the Rico
It's hard f*ckin with niggaz you hope you can trust
You a fool if your main bitch is easy to f*ck
And you've got money - is these hoes greedy or what?
Shit is devious, ex-friends wantin you stuck



 
Uhh, what's love when you don't give your man enough dough?
He wanna stick you
What's love, you got beef?
Nobody rollin wit you
What's love, you locked up, and your family don't care
Is love a four-letter word, that deceives the air?
What's real, when you know your man's girl is a hoe
And you don't even let him know, cause you f*cked her befo'
What's real, when you talk behind a man's back
then you see him and give him dap, now explain that?
What's trust, when they seperate your case
When you at your court date, your co-de', can't look in your face
What's trust, when you keep your wife away from your man?
And he never crossed you, but you claimin he's fam'?
What's trust, when you get bust, your niggaz don't retaliate?
They blaze purple haze with em the next day?
God forbid one of my niggaz get hit, I'ma go haywire
Won't hesitate, I'ma spray fire
But everybody's different, you won't know how you react
til you in that position, and that's an actual fact
The hearts of men change as time goes on, who's wrong?
You was hungry when you stuck Duke, he came back to buck you
Who's wrong?    Foul all your life, now you 90
On your deathbed you regret bein grimy
What's lust, a bust nut?    What's a thug?
A ghetto child raised around drugs, til he's old enough to bust slugs?
Then what's jail, to rehabilitate, or to make a nigga worse
when he come home to catch another case?
Life's about decisions, you choose it, you gotta live it
You did it, heaven or hell or prison
Who knows when your clock'll s  tickin, get your weight up
Save up before it's over neighbor, I told ya


 
Uh, 2000 G

Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back
You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that
You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat
Cuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em
Century 21 solar eclipse 
While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc
Thelonius, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet
AK is my heat, everyday in the street till I lay six feet
QB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps
Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto
Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles
Pop bottles with those who left here
The best years, wearin a bulletproof vest years
The aim for the head and chest years
What's your name? Make your name known
For the next year's, better rep, yeah

[1] - Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus

Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus
Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar      
Now he is Nastrodamus

I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits
The Nastrodamus tell us what time it is
I was the first one on that Don shit
First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit
Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips
Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch
Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell
Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels
Hood rats and bullet wound up females
Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail
Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips
Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit
A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills 
Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels
She come to scoop me, I chill
Leave streets alone for a sec
Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech
Uh

[Repeat 1]

Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone
Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne
We gon' rep it the best that we can
Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man
But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now
Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend
And they don't understand how you C.E.O. from heaven
But that's another level, brethren
Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's
We do squeeze, thought it's not right
But that's the zone that we left in
Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches
Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks  less
Lap s with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes
And we all roll dice, for each other's ice
And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys?
But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm...

[Repeat 1]




[Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)]

Some of us have angels -- the kingdom, the power
Some of us have angels -- the power, the glory
Some of us have demons -- greed, and lust
Some of us have demons -- lust, temptation

 
Now this is you, dressed in all black, fatigue hat, ready for combat
A good nigga, you don't leave tracks
A hood nigga wantin G-stacks, do what you gotta do to get that
You feel you need that, where the jooks at?
These are your niggaz, creepin they be leavin niggaz sleep witchu
Loc' style, quiet no smile, it's the official
Sometime they grimy, speakin on they own people
They snake you if they have to, raised tattoos
Now these are your bitches, phonin lonely homey chickens
All the homies stick em, you think you own em man listen
She stab you in your sleep with a knife from out the kitchen
Put a root on you, next week they find you missin
Dead in your Expedition in the forest, fell off the cliff and
tumbled til you blew up, Feds told her and she threw up
Fake bitches, actresses, wicked witch practices
Two sides of us, negative or positive



 
Now this is your mom, your good luck charm
Pushin you to do no wrong, prayin for you that you live long
Nobody kill my baby, but she know her baby crazy
In and out of jail, mom's screamin, "God take me!"
This is your pop, chip off the old block that made him
The man of the house, mom and pops seperatin
Spittin image of a gangster the way pop walked
the way pop talked, got older and you thanked him now
This is your hood, poor folks drugs and robberies
Turnin into the things moms wanted you not to be
Crime followin the wrong dudes who have no values
Life's cheap as the dime in the minds of those around you
This is the test, the stress, the conflict the ups and downs of
niggaz around you make threats
They tell you keep it gangster, no matter the predicament
Even though your decision won't help you benefit



 
Now once again this is you, entertainin your desires
Bitches money and guns, aimin and you fire
Everyday is grief, if it ain't beef, it's feedin your seed
Tryin to eat?    You form material needs
The weed make your brain sizzle, a pistol make it cool off
by stickin up niggaz, make them take they jewels off
His reputation is, bigger than his whole life span
He never planned to fail, he just failed to plan
What does it take to realize, Satan's alive, he whispers
And any chance he get, he can take niggaz
He comes in all shapes and sizes, his best disguise is
when he stand beside us, but God is inside us, within me
You are your worst enemy - my mom's words echo in my head
And if I let go I'm dead
He stepped at my door, the ? motivate my spirit
And now the body experience, so now I feel it
Lookin at my blessings, the bullets - that missed me coulda hit me
Them court cases coulda put me in the penitentiary
I never hate, that's just wasted energy
The past is gone, the present's a gift, so what's the mystery?
The future - and time only reveals, what fear is
False expectations, appearin real
We only human, love thy neighbor, so I was told
and I will til permanently, my eyes are closed









Black hoods, cops 'n projects
sewers flooded with foul blockage
The gutter's wild and every child watches
Changin   locks with ripped off hinges
doors kicked off, drunks stag off smirnoff, wipe your beard off
Crippled dope fiends in wheelchairs stare
vision blurry, cus buried deep in they mind are hidden stories
Bet he's a mirror image of that 70's era
finished for the rest of his life, till he fades out
The liquor store workers miss him but then it plays out
so many ways out the hood but no signs say out
Mental slavehouse where gats go off, I show off
niggas up north, prison-ology talk, till they time cut off
You should chill if you short, prepare deep thought
to hit the street again, get it on, get this paper and breathe again
Plan to leave somethin' behind
so your name'll live on, no matter what the game lives on


Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired

Yo, if this piano's the cake then my words are the candles
Light it up, make a wish, and them angels will grant you
Impatient once tried, but in those angels and bamboo
they lit it up, *puff* *puff*, hit it up, *puff*
Now they dismantled, think the whole world is crazy, got a 9
watch where you walk, 2 dollar fine, sign of the times here in New York
Hi Satan, United Nations quietly taken, to own your soul
take it or leave it, just my evaluation
Stack loot and guns, teach the girls karate, school your sons not to hate
but to stay awake, cus the scars a razor make is nothin' in comparison
to the gas left on this whole mass, if we don't get it controlled fast
might as well be, laughin' with Malcolm X's assassin as we die slow
perishin', brain dead from a Erickson
Words are the medicine, two teaspoons for goons
a cup of it for those thuggin' it, y'all sing the tune



Another day, another dollar, my mother will holla
She said "go and see the world for myself, and my brother Shafala"
Pops was smooth, from his   to his shoes
sang the rules, guitar strings he played smokin' his ?
? hat, picture this yo, seventies cat
He wrote his music in the back of the crib, I did my homework
At night the windows were speakers, pumpin' life out
a fight, people screamin' cus somebody pulled a knife out
So I look at this poem, I'm hooked to this tune
every night the same melody, hell sounded so heavenly
But jail was ahead of me, ??
Reading's what I should've done, cus my imagination would run
I was impatient to get out and become part of the noise out there
I used to stare, five stories down, basketball courts, shot up playgrounds
and I witnessed the murders and police shake-downs
Yo, the hustlas and hoes, drugs and fo-fos
This was the life of every kid, lookin' out project windows

Oh, outta my window
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, it makes me feel, so tired
Lookin' out of my project window
Oh, I feel uninspired
Starin out of, of my window
Oh I, feel so tired
Oh yeah, outta my window
Oh, lookin' out, lookin' out
Lookin' out my window, oh yeah
Makes me, feel so tired
Outta my window, out my project window
Lord I feel, uninspired









And as a special treat this evening
I have asked America's foremost young poet
to read his latest poem for us

[scratching by DJ Premier:]
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"We-we-we came a long way"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"

 
Yo..
Yo.. yo..
Power and crime, the thugs slingin powder and dimes
Twenties of D, is yo' niggaz wilder than mine?
My niggaz bust nines, puff lye and stick up cowards
for they shine, you resist, then you push up flowers
I'm like Lou Cabrasi, Vito's best hit-man
That's "Godfather" shit, back seat, next lit plans
Revolvers spit, I'm too tough to bargain with
And you don't want the God to pull up the cars that's sick
Arms and wrists is lit up, Queensbridge Kings
Plaques awards applause when I do my thing
Streets is black as midnight, the concrete gray
with stains of blood and germ and piss all day
Come on the ave, get sized up, plus appraised
Duck and pray that my guns dont' bust your way
Niggaz with names, livin off reputation
Sometimes gotta remind you ain't nothin changin

[scratching by DJ Premier:] 
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"

[Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)]

If you ill come get me, cause I ain't runnin
If your gun's off the hook then we'll both be gunnin
Come get me if you real, cause I ain't scared
It's all fair in love and war
[1] - and I'm well prepared
[2] - we can take it there

 
You don't like me clown?    Now you wanna take me down?
If I bring my face around, you gon' do what?    You butt
Your crew knew I blew up, I been shinin - baseball diamonds
Dick rings for your chicklings
Niggaz know what my nine pearl handle's about
F*ck you say girlie mouth?    Get it krunk like the Dirty South
And I know you see me flossed out, multi-milli-i
Hear your bitch talk about me, you give her the cold eye?
Girls dig you, imagine what she feel for me?
You make hot songs, but she know you steal from me
Who ill as me?    I wild on haters in album three
Next level - I take y'all niggaz to 3-D
Can't find a nigga shook from Queens
I'll be with the most grimy killers 
(what nigga) and they all look clean
who put bombs underneath cars, if you want beef then start
Your next s  is to the graveyard



 
You too feminine to kill again, jail got you soft
You talk but you scared to go back up North
Keep your face twisted, but you don't really want nuttin
Talk a bunch of shit motherf*cker and s  frontin
You don't wanna flip again, and sell drugs again
Be on the run again, catch you at the Comfort Inn
Shoot up your door, bust in on you and your whore
Put y'all in bags, clean the blood off of the floor
So play tough, I want y'all to get out of line
I got nines, every color shape and design
I sent killers every race to put one in your spine
Two in your ear, get your crew, who do I fear?
Nobody never get involved and none of em dyin
I think like you do, roll with about two irons
Catch me flyin, high in the aircraft winin
- and dinin, you die, then we laugh, you bitch-ass
?? to gauze up, your stab wounds
While I'm gettin head, in a Lear jet, bathroom
With all my goons, all my ice, and suitcases
full of paper, not money it's bank statements
The Illmatic that explains how we rock
Yachts and co-ops, we buy the hood and sell you a block



[scratching by DJ Premier:] 
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"We-we-we came a long way"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"
"Everybody watch him"
"ladies and gentlemen.."
"Na-Na-Na-Nastradamus"

{"Hydro Drops" weed skit follows}



  
One 44, two 45's
3 loaded clips, 4 niggas roll, one nigga drives
500 Benz, 6 reasons why 
This kid should die
We shootin every motherf*cker outside
Pulled on his block, jumped out the car, guns in our hand
At the same time everybody ran
There that nigga go, hiding in the crowd
Let the trigger blow, 7 shots now he lying on the ground
Blood on the floor
Then we shot some more 
Niggas he was with
2 niggas hit, one nigga fell
One tryed to run, go get him son 
Make sure he's done before we bail, i aint trying to goto jail
Must handle beef, code of the street 
Load up the heat, if these nigga think they could f*ck around
Real niggas do real things
By all means, niggas knowin how we get down.. It goes......

[Chorus (3X)]
Shoot 'em up, just shoot 'em up, what..
(whispering) 
Kill kill kill, murder murder murder

 
Driving through roads, Suburban Chevrolet
6 tinted windows, and I'm on my way
To get up with my hoes, I pull up to they house
Not a freak to be heard, nobody came out
Ringin the bell, where in the hell
Could they be at, I'm about to leave
Steppin' slow, where my truck was at
Who the f*ck is that?
Could it be a jack?
Now pull my strap, it's my man
And we have the same plan
There them bitches go
Civic '94, looking funny though 
Open up the car door, funny smile
F*ck 2 already, 3rd ass was heavy 
"Nas this is Sherri, Sherri this is Nas, and his man. Ready?"
Walked in the house, snatched off they clothes 
Ran through them hoes 
Plenty ice, that they all seemed to like
Can't find my man, heard a blam blam
Now I'm wonderin, "In this scam, do I even stand a chance?"
He killed the hoes, took all they doe
Fire in his eyes, higher than the sky
Comin down the stairs
Now he wantin mine, reachin for my nine 
Aiming with our guns at each others face, at the same time
my nine on his lips, his fifth on my chin, I start whispering 
"Put your gun down, we can skip town"
Rocked him to sleep, pushed back his meat
Lift off his chain
Took his shit, emptied out close range...

[Chorus (4X)]
[3rd time there is no whispering of: "kill kill kill, murder murder muder".]











 
These are last words of a hanging slave
How could I forget this
I rob you put you on my hit list
Under my nails are dirty look at the grime
My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broker than a dope bitch
Powerful mind we brave men
I blow smoke and I'ma keep sayin

[Nashawn]
These are last words of a hanging slave

My burnt lips from the roach clips
How can I shine
Being broke and bag a dope bitch
Powerful minds we brave men
I'ma blow smoke and keep sayin
I wanna be more than that bullet that go through ya zone
Wanna be the lead that tear through ya skin and crack bones
Wanna be the heat you feel makin ya moan
Wanna be the hospital bed that you lay on
Wanna be the god you feel when you pray-on
It's Nashawn the type that get the hyper-con
I'm gonna kill something 
Rap cats be real frontin
F*ck shootin legs
Cock back put his brains on the pave
Nigga how bout that
Close range with the gadge get payed
First rapper to shoot off stage
Turn the front page the next day my life is like a book
A twenty four hour song without no hook
Millennium Thug computer chips up in my slug
Turn quarters when you turn quarters know who to plug
Thugs around me outside its grimmy outside
Better slide before you get bodied outside

I'ma prison cell six by nine
Livin hell stone wall metal bars for the gods in jail
My nickname the can, the slammer, the big house
I'm the place many fear cause there's no way out
I take the sun away put misery instead
When you wit me most folks consider you dead
I saw too many inmates fallin apart
Call for the guards to let them out at night when it's dark
Convicts think they alone but if they listen close
They can hear me groan touch the wall feel my pulse
All the pictures you put up is stuck to my skin
I hear ya prayers (even when ya whisperin)
I make it hotter in the summer colder in the winter
If the court paroal ya then another con enters
No remorse for your tears I seen em too often
When you cry I make you feel alive inside a coffin
Watch you when you eat play with you mind when you sleep
Make you dream that you free then make you wake up to me
Face to face with a cage no matter your age
I can shatter you turn you into a savage in rage
Change ya life that's if you get a chance to get out
Cause only you and I know what sufferings about
Yo it's stunning when bed sheets become your woman
And I'm the one that gotcha weapons when the beef is comming
Maybe one day I'll open up my arms to release you
You'll always be my property nigga stay legal






[Havoc]
Yo..

Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Allah Havoc gettin right, on them 747

Dunn you fam to me, and only family

Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Forty decide, on the First side right

[Prodigy]
Me and my Dunns come from the slums
You can't take the slums out my Dunns 
and that's how it is, that's how we live
Sometimes I find myself wearin the same shit for days
not carin, bout what they gon' think or say
I got that, "I don't give a f*ck" in me, it's stuck in me
That's how I 'vantage over y'all niggaz, y'all too pretty
We too gritty, like Sanford and Son (what)
Too grimy like Pigpen with jewels on
See we the   rap niggaz, the Q-Dogs
You got a lot of nerve, puttin out them songs
knowin that my niggaz come strong, so let's get it on
We just gettin warm, Operation "Quiet Storm"
Silent wars or we silence the fours
Half P and I's got it in the smash for sure
Now it's movies and soundtracks
This is where your career s  at

 
Aiyyo I drink to that
I'm like a dictionary, y'all rappers exam me
You ballet?    They read your obituary, in front your family
You should idolize Nas in the flesh
Don't wait til I'm dead, to say I was the best, no doubt
We shot hoops with coathangers, got loot with dopeslangers
Sold soap to strangers, joked with danger
Rob prostitutes, dodge cops in hot pursuit
Bought weight from rosters, travel hot routes
O.T. commute back and forth
Tell shorty get that package off
F*ck bein trapped up North, being told where to eat and shit
Caught a case then I beat the shit
Theives on the block flash badges, nylon jackets
Big white boys with guns yellin, "Freeze black kids!"
Got my niggaz in the pen, eatin oc us
Wishin they was on the blocks with us
to watch me and P do it (uh) put the heat to it (uh)
Put it out, first day, the whole street knew it
Bitches, hold they pussies and bop to the music
and think deep to it, now who the truest?

[Mobb Deep]
Yo..

Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Allah Havoc gettin right, on them 747

Dunn you fam to me, and only family

Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Yo you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Are you fam to me, and only fam to me
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong

[Prodigy]
Dirty fingernails, reachin in my pocket pullin knots out
I daydream of better days, in different ways
out this lifestyle we live, iced out with the big fifth
That's why the burnt leather lean to the left
Even though we gained cash on fish
I'm trapped on reason bein we ain't all rich
And I'ma be that same nigga for the door
And I'ma still walk the same path, we soon clash
We get stacks, you do the math
We pound niggaz out, walk away and laugh
Fresh from out the lab, P and Nastradamus kid
Rap niggaz shit they drawers

 
Yo they probably did
I aircondition y'all niggaz, my prediction is you rewind this
Your highness, Q-Boro's finest
Click your Timbs three times, the wizard is Nas
Grant you a wish, you get rich while listenin hard
To my thugs in the prisonyard, bench-pressin 200 pounds and up
Feelin like you down on your luck
Raise up, I feel your pain, hit the law library
Appeal the game, all eyes on me
Restrained from, bein looked at, as uncivilized
We epitomize thug song, y'all niggaz get mad
Jealous rappers is puss, ain't got no style
no heart and no look, shook
Get stole on, my niggaz move right in the moonlight
Y'all niggaz get done, I pee on them son, they a small issue
We too official, blue steel pistols
Teflon vests, it's no contest we hit you

[Mobb Deep]
Dunn you fam to me, and only family
that can get that close to me
Keep it type strong
Blowin green that's keepin us goin
Unconditional love showin

Yo, yo, yo, yo
Forty decide, Forty-First side right

Yeah youknahmsayin?    Not for nuttin baby
Knahmsayin wanna give a shout out to my peoples
YouknowhatImean?    Gamble, Ill Will
Killa Black, my brother
It's never gonna be another
Word up..

Yeah, you know how we do things



 
Uhh..
Uh.. speak without thinkin..
speak without speakin.. huh..
Feel without reachin, uhh
That's what it's about
It's about that, inner, inner love, yaknawmean?

[Chorus: Nas]

God love us hood niggaz (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz (I know)
and the killers, God love us good niggaz (I know)
Cause on the streets is the hood niggaz, uhh
And I know he feel us, uhh
God love us hood niggaz (I know)
Cause he be wit us in the prisons
and he takes time to listen, uhh
God love us hood niggaz (I know)
Cause next to Jesus on the cross was the crook niggaz, uhh
but he forgive us

 
He who has ears, let him hear
And he who has sight, let him see
He who has life, let him be
See everything goes through change
Those who know don't talk
and those who talk don't know a thing
Men are born soft and turn tough
Dead lay a stiffened heart, I've been kissed by God
I've been hurt, I've been marked for death, almost ripped apart
by the beast but he missed his mark
Alone in the dark my thoughts had sparked up
when I saw my body on the floor, from above I watch it all
Yo it came to me, the pain in me
Many slain empty skulls where a brain should be
It strangely seemed, like it was a dream
but the si-rens had never woke me
Only reason I'm here now is cause God chose me
And to me, I'm only just a crook nigga
But God love us hood niggaz



 
Day by day by day I sit back and pray
My thugs get packed away, in a maxi-cage
They pass away, they went off the casket way
My gats will spray, but that won't bring em back today
So long my crimies now gone for eternity
The team we got left on the set, now turn to me
Can't speak, tears in my eyes, revenge in my mind
I ride past the church where they got his body and find
they takin him to the hearse to put his body in dirt
That's it, pay my respects, wipe my tears with my shirt
Now it's time to do work, out of love and retribution
As loyalty, he would die for me, no excuses
Loadin clips up, countin bullets carefully
For self, though it feels like, he was there for me
Saw the enemy, I ate him, saw Jakes behind me
They ain't knock me, it's obvious that God's watchin me



 
Jealousy in the hood, felonies in the hood
Thugs wit guns become celebrities in the hood
Yo it's beef in the hood, smoke trees in the hood
Little girls have seeds by O.G.'s in the hood
It's food in the hood, it's drugs in the hood
You can choose if you would, coke to sniff
Dope to ooze in your blood, parolees
ex-cons live in the hood, it's jobs in the hood
You can starve in the hood
Your best friends'll f*ck your baby moms in the hood
But it's good in the hood
I was raised in the hood
Was taught how to walk and duck strays in the hood
I stays in the hood, got my ways from the hood
Learned to play ball go to the NBA, in the hood
There's AIDS (uh) in the hood (WHAT?)
Our lives are the worst, on   of that, we broke
That's the main reason why God, love us the most

[Chorus 2X]




Where my real niggas at
Theres a lot of real niggas out there
Theres a lot of real niggas everywhere
Thats why you don't f*ck with just anybody
A lot of niggas is just on the low, chillin
Not botherin nobody, until one motha f*cka f*ck with em
And then all hell break loose

[Hook (2)]
Quiet niggas will kill
Loud niggas talk shit
Them be the ones that get killed
It's wild where we walk kid
Is you brave nigga
Is you a slave nigga
Is you a made nigga
Or is you a paid nigga

Well known gangstas, in trust
That we bust
Your heart and soul lies with us
Boldly go where we once took a nigga before
Now the motha f*cka beggin for more
Its the reason
Standin here shakin, hatin the haters
They watchin my paper
Realize, a 4 5 will open his eyes
Now what the f*ck you think he saw before he drop
Nigga standin there just like a cop
Braveheart I'm screamin up the block
Now the soldier, cadet, general in fact
Don't let me get up and show yawl motha f*cka's respect
Plans connect
The twinkle and diamonds upon my neck
More jazz than Hornecek
I blast and leave your corner wet
Straight on   of ya
Spittin like the trench coat mafia
In a school yard we make it hard
Was poppin yawl
We made our change was s pin yawl
They spray your names rest in peace on the ?? wall

[Hook (2)]

I wave gang signs at the youth, thats down for the cause
Cling them things in the ?? you betta get yours
Time is runnin out
Your streets is gettin smaller as we speak
Juliani turns these lights on so niggas can't creep
I miss the shit of days we did this
Please free John Gotti
They kept the black man eatin, not killin everybody
Drug wars is real
You have no friends in the outfield
Foul balls is deaf, umpires keep ice grilles
Theres no tomorrow its the bottom of the 9 9
Can't die a broke man with a bitch thats fine
My hearts full of braveness so who the f*ck will want to save this
Fallen angel from fallen star and chaos on this nation
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin
You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin
Don't play us on your station if you pussy or you hatin
You can find us in the hood; thuggin and regulatin

[Hook (2)]

We here to eat food, my peoples, be lethal
Shots in your body make you see through
Quiet niggas become jail riot niggas
25 to life, big never cry niggas
Floss when they up north
Chest gettin bigger
Celebs on the V I respect that nigga
Rege on the regular chops is up; like a editor
Come through on man gang like the predator
If yawl wake I'll wet it up
Jungle set it up
The jackal rock you to sleep while I'm comin at you
Air out your area, Queens Bridge forever, what
Ill will the label
Bravehearts yawl scared of us

Yo when those niggas ran these niggas stayed
With these niggas switched up and bitched up afraid
These niggas clicked up and ripped up the gauge
Those niggas got jail and sick cause we paid
Don't even rep Q B
You ain't got hood stripes
Looters come through catch you frontin
And its good night
Know how much force this is
Juggle horse and whiz
Notin but horses kid
We go to war for this

[Hook (3)]






(You're a big girl now)
Fully grown with your hormones now
Got your own home and you alone
Wanna bone, wanna moan, get your back blown out
(No more daddy's little girl)
You a big girl now, in a world, where these niggas are foul
You could be aborting the next Michael Jordan
Your man don't wanna be around
(You're a big girl now)
She's sexy, she got it, she ride it
Every nigga wanna be inside it
(No more daddy's little girl)
I need her, I'll eat her
Do anything to please her
My ghetto queen of Sheba


I'm the type that'll get you by the fireplace
Get you hype when I lick it, put it in your face
Sipping red wine, is it bedtime
You can kick it with your nigga while we listen to Faith
I'm feeling richer today
I can hit it then stay
Lingerie make me take it to the kitchen and play
We got champagne, whipped cream, I'ma grab a bucket of ice
Bubble bath running, and the candlelight feeling so right
It's your night, no stress, no fight
Mad at your ex, cause his dough tight
Never go right when you're with him
Try your best to forget him
Cause it's easy to please me
CD skip when your head board hit the wall
Call for the law
Right when you cum, I'm biting your tongue
Make your legs cramp up, you can't stand up
You can hit a blunt if you want
I'ma pull my pants up
We can discuss a weekend of lust on   of the trust
Tell me what's the reason for us
To love or to f*ck
I'm the thug that you want
If it's gangster we can't front
If you want me I can stay around
If you need me, I'm here for you
How that sound?
Now it's up to you
Depending on how you wanna get down
Cause you're a big girl now




Got your name and your number in my cell phone
Hear your voice and I wonder where you are, if you all alone
If you in a good mood, if you not
Or you thinking bout you was at my spot
What we did when we got hot
Is you dreaming you had me?
Is you creaming your panties?
Like a king, fed me grapes, and you fanned me
On the couch, to the floor, to the bed, to the sink
And we ate each other like candy
Under the covers, two intimate lovers
You f*ck a nigga like you mad at me
Throw the ass to me
You should be glad to be
In the presence of a real thug as bad as me
While I'm in the streets with my murdering squad
You talking to your friends that I'm hurting it hard
How I'm making my rod, how I make you say "Oh God"
Every hoe that you know wanna know Nas
Gotta dodge all the blowjobs, getting hard
Cause you know how these girls are
Wearing tight shit, no panties, no bra
Running up to my car with menage a trois suggestions
Starting to get an erection
Guessing, only if you knew how your crew stressing
Complexion chocolatey, fondle me, thinking it's time to leave
I need time to breathe
Wanna follow me, Ironically
You pop up, throwing bottles at my Tahoe
Like it's my fault
But you don't wanna talk
Don't wanna hear nothing, all of a sudden
You and the shorty start scuffing
Now shorty dumping you out
Can't let her get the best of you
So I rescue you
Only thing left to do was to grab her
So you can jab her, get a cheap shot
You don't wanna feel chumped
Now here the cops come
So we gotta run to the ride
Then we drive off through the traffic
Don't panic, but you know how we gotta manage
Looking at your face
And the damage in your facial
Every angle can't let it faze you
No reason to be insecure or immature
Baby girl see the world is yours

[Chorus fade out]





Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world, 
It's a new world, it's a new world
Uh, it's a new world, it's a new world

Yo, celebrate the new life
New ways to make money
New ways to break dummies
Forge they name and take money
Computers ain't that smart
Whatever man built could be taken apart
Anything new can get old
Like dudes started rockin' platinum, some s ped wearin gold
solar-energized rides, no steering wheel, tell it how to drive
No propellers in the sky
Airplanes like many rockets
Waitin lists for the rich to get tickets to visit Mars
While the poor people starve, computers takin over they jobs
A man's forced to live off land
Now it's back to the caveman era
When we made fire, by two sticks rubbin together
The truth is, many are too scared of new data
America Online, cut off, see you later

[(Hook) 2x]
Yo, welcome to the new world, new beginnin
A new way to play, a new way a livin
Cash is the past, a new way a spendin
New life for man, children, and women

Yo, the new Mike Tyson's Roy Jones
Bill Clinton's the new JFK, without the hole in his dome
The new Don Trump is Bill Gates
Not because his occupation, it's 'cause we respect his cake
And cake mean his stock, net gross
Young kids step it up, go for the most
New cameras in police cars takin pictures
New hustlas gettin new street figures
And US embassies overseas
almost every foreign country's under seige
Covertly startin wars, CIA, NAVY Seals
Commit larcenies that be worth over mil's
Oil in the earth spills
Girls blow they body up, birth control pills
African's pick diamonds out a dark caves
Then we wear it on our necks just so we can light up the stage



Say goodbye to the brainwashed
Say goodbye to the young kids who not smart
Say goodbye to the toasters and Pop-Tarts
Yo, it's real
Swallow a little pill, there's a four-course meal
Say hello to the one world
Say hello to the sky, somethin's out there watchin you and I
More enticin than Star Trek, StarTec phones
Your genes and DNA is used to make clones 
You got CD-Rom, everythang operates by computers
Then what happens when circuit breaks
Y2K's the big scare
Scientists say we ain't prepared
What I feel is contrare
Alexander Graham Bell made telephones, yes
But now we request for your e-mail address
I might be old fashioned, stuck in my ways
But nothin make me more happier than seein today





 
Uh, it's real, it's real, it's real
Uh, uh, owe me back, uh shorty
Shorty, what up, huh?
Come on

[1 - Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something

 
Yeah, owe me back like you owe your tax
Owe me back like forty acres to Blacks
Pay me back when you shake it like that girl

[2 - Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price 
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe

 
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I spent
Pay me back when you shake it again

The don, all the time, with all the shine
You small time, I ball with mine
Links, minks, Bentley, it's all with mine
My jams bump out to the borderline
UK hot with it, blew spots with it
Every continent love when I spit it
Corners to blocks, even the cops feel it
Brothas on lockdown on their cots feel it
It's real in the field the Last Mohican
Who survived in the streets and did something decent
Now I got plans to buy the whole hood
Legit' now, I ain't gotta lie to no judge
I make hits now, money I flip now
Hood fella every honey wanna kiss now
I lit up my neck, pinkie, and wrist now
So girls everywhere, this is how we get down

[Repeat 1]

[3 - Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price 
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe, owe, owe

 
Yeah owe me back like you owe your rent
Owe me back like its money I lent
Pay me back when you shake it again

 
Play to win, girls in the club moving
I get 'em real hot, my songs seduce 'em
I flow, I'm so mysterious
Nas, and Nasty's the alias
Everything platinum I glow
Cadillac trucks pulling up to the do'
On   out the car, lounge at the bar
We spent a thou', we wild, look at how rowdy we are
Feel like a million dollars, feel me holler
To the max with the Benz and chrome wheeled Impalas
Thugs and renta's, to the playas and ballers
Sexy mamas, fly ladies lookin' proper
Look good enough to be taken shoppin'
Earrings, bracelets, now you rocking
Your body's so nice that I give you this option
Let you wear my big chain if we get it popping

[Repeat 1]
[Repeat 2]

[Ginuwine] 
I put the shackles on your feet (You owe me)
I think you owe me some (You owe me)
The shackles on your feet (You owe Nas)
I think you owe me some (You owe Ginuwine)
(You owe Timbaland, you owe me)

 
Lock you down baby, you know what you owe me
Mack like Goldie, it's the same story
Let you hold something, you spending it right
Know where you gon' be by the end of the night
Make it bounce, shake it, move it around
Wiggle it a little bit, throw it to the south
Fantasizing me inside and you riding
Throw it like a stallion, you wearin' my medallion

[Ginuwine]
Shorty, say what's your price
Just to back it up
You can hold my ice
Now let's say you owe me something
(You owe me something, oh yeah)
I said shorty, say what's your price
(You owe Nas)
Just to back it up
(You owe Ginuwine)
You can hold my ice
(You owe Timbaland)
Now let's say you owe
You owe us something, baby
Oh, oh, oh





[Jessica Care Moore]
Global warming between my legs, screams against the waves
Gave birth to thirteen daughters, so now we never run out of water
My skin layered in diamonds and sage
Left alone and confused, forces enslaved by days
Time keeps on whorin us
Ghetto saviors can't keep ignorin us
Flowers and flames, flutes from her fingers
Rifles pointed from her sac
or was it simply a bag of sticks and stones
Either way, she wore a compass on her head
Rains don't s  the grass from turnin red
Her hair was half perm, half dread
We gave up walking in a past-life and so we dance
Arms wrapped around my breath and choked me back to life
A new world wife, reflecting the sun and rolling dice
Symbol of the drama yet to come - too late to run
Time travelling was late
Watching was a blind man's mistake
All his assets melted right in front of his face
His right leg drabbed with demon paste
Shoes stayed angel laced
Never count your blessings with haste
Even a prophet can catch a case
Didn't realize how sweet the future might taste
Telepathically cutting through mental gates
Words were weapons against their hate
Shepherds search for stars in her hair
Her chest grew fermented like yeast
She broke her body like aged bread
He gave her truth from all the books he'd read
She wrote her poems inside the mud
Sacrificed her cervix to fix the future
Named their boys and spit truth inside his mouth
Read warm prophet, writing twisted scriptures inside her belly
Resurrected from bones and dirt
She made hard niggaz smile
Left her seeds inside the Earth
Gave hustlers and killers life's worth
This is the life we chose, remember who was here first
Find a reason why you curse
Gold rushed tongues by dreams too loose
Sporting electronic nooses
Hoeing humanity love-ticks over lust
Despite the damage to destiny you can't take the best of me
In God We Still Trust



 
Uhh
Yo, yo-yo, y'all
Whattup?    Whattup
It's time man (Word, it's time?)
Straight up, it's time man
Aight, set that shit off
(Set it off then nigga, set it off)

Broken glass in the hallway, bloodstained floors
Neighbors, look at every bag you bring through your doors
Lock the   lock, momma shoulda cuffed me to the radiator
Why not?    It might've saved later from my block
N.Y. cops, hookers crawlin off the stroll, coughin
stitches in they head, stinkin and I dread thinkin they be snitchin
But who else, could it be, shook at these, unmarked vans
Parked in the dark -- NARC's, where's your heart?
Hustlers starve; they bust a U-e I jog
to my building -- come out later wearin camouflage
See the sergeant and the captain -- strangle men
Niggaz gaspin for air; til they move no more and just stare
with dead eyes -- tired of riots, shit is quiet
Simple-minded fools infiltrate grimy crews
Overcrowded cribs, uncles home from bids, sister's pregnant
father's on drugs, moms is smokin, beds is piss-infested
Had eight partners growin up, eight turned to seven
Seven turned to six niggaz, got two in heaven
Six of us, holdin it, now it's five rollin thick
The sixth one's parole flipped; five niggaz, went to fo' quick
when he went O.T., college life, converted into gangbangin
Four niggaz still hangin, years passed and slang changin
Three of us now, fourth nigga ain't around
We all thought he was real -- he did the snake shit
Fake shit -- beat his ass down, yo his mouth
could've got us all wasted, what a f*ckin clown
All I got left in the end is two of my best friends
And we all goin out, to the death for these ends, WHAT?

New York, New York ("New York state of mind" -> [Rakim])
New York, New York ("New York state of mind" -> [Rakim])
[repeat while Nas is talking]

You heard about it, you see about it
You read about it, it's in your papers
It's in your daily news ("Get money!")
New York chronicles, every day
The crime rate, the murder rate
The money rate, the paper chase, youknowhatImean?
New York state of mind baby, check it out

 
I'm at the, gamblin spot, my hands on a knot
New York Yankee cap cover my eyes, stand in one spot
I take a nigga dough, send him home, to a shoebox
You lost that nigga I put your dollar in the jukebox
Hear my favorite song, all these niggaz sing along
All the ciggarette smoke's cloggin my lungs, hoodrats flashin they tongue
Young thugs blastin they gun, we got reputations
Bitches and niggaz both on parole or probation
Shit is sick, niggaz got gats, army fatigues
I got my eyes glued on, whoever walk in the lead
Cause I ain't playin, niggaz'll run up in here and shoot up this shit
Stick yo' ass up, niggaz'll find the loot in your kicks
Bunch of triple-cross niggaz, just New York niggaz
Lift you off your feet when they was just talkin with you
Some of these dudes the Feds be on em, you knew em for years
Be the type when you walk in a pub, they offer you beers
That ain't gangsta, niggaz is up North with tatted tears
Your name's on the affadavit, you ratted kid
Faggot-ass niggaz that be scared to do they bids
F*ck you, we run you out of N.Y, you can't live
Got your quiet niggaz, that relocated down South
comin back to floss, then you got the jealous loudmouths
All of a sudden we got Crips and Bloods, D.T.'s
runnin round quick to split your mug, it's ea-sy to score
but it's hard to get the shit off
Niggaz fightin over hundred sales, jump in the car and drive off
When the fiend come around the block, happy as hell
Niggaz, mad cause they ain't get a piece of that sale
Cutthroat connivers, universal, ghetto survivors
Go to any hood that's live and make it liver
A lot of niggaz scheamin, some real, some niggaz frontin
But I'm a big dreamer, so watch me come up with somethin

New York, New York
New York, New York



[Puff] Escobar season has returned...

 
It's been a long time, been a long time comin
Looks like the death of me now
But you know, there's no turning back now
This is what makes me - this is what I am

[Puff] Feel me?    Let's go

[Base Chorus: Puff Daddy]
You can hate me now.. but I won't s  now..
Cause I can't s  now.. you can hate me now..
But I won't s  now.. cause I can't s  now..
You can hate me now.. you can hate me NOWWWW..

[1st Chorus: add Nas after each pause]
Q.B., real niggas, Bravehearts, c'mon

[1st Chorus: after Nas add Puff Daddy ad lib]
Well you hate me I'm gon' hate you too
It's as simple as that
Die motherf*cker die motherf*cker die
You don't give a f*ck I don't give a f*ck
Go down any way you want it to go down (do it now)
Weak, jealous motherf*ckers (do it now, do it now)
F*ck y'all!


Don't hate me, hate the money I see, clothes that I buy
Ice that I wear, clothes that I try, close your eyes
Picture me rollin, sixes, money foldin
Bitches honies that swollen to riches, Nas get in ya
Most critically acclaimed Pulitzer, prize winner
Best storyteller thug narrator my style's greater
Model dater, big threat to a lot of you haters
Commentators ringside try watchin my paper
Almost a decade, quite impressive
Most of the best is in the essence
for this rap shit that I stand for
Expandin more to the big screen, Bill Gates dreams
But it seems you'd rather see me in jail with state greens
Want me off the scene fast, but good things last
like your favorite MC still makin some mean cash
First rapper to bring a platinum plaque, back to the projects
but you still wanna hate, be my guest, I suggest

[Puff Daddy]
Money is power motherf*cker
I got millions of thugs on salary, bitch (do it now)

[Base Chorus]

[2nd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]
I won't s 
I can't s 
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

  Do it now, I   you do it now
[Puff] Let's go


You wanna hate me then hate me; what can I do
but keep gettin money, funny I was just like you
I had to hustle hard never give up, until I made it
Now y'all sayin that's a clever nigga, nuttin to play with
Hate on me, I blew but I'm the same ol G
People warn me, when you're on   there's envy
Took my niggas out the hood, but you doubt on us
Sayin we left the hood but can't get it out of us
My bad, should I step out my shoes, give 'em to you?
Here's my cars and my house, you can live in that too
Criticize when I flow for the streets, hate my dress code
Gucci this, Fendi that, what you expect hoe?
Nickname Esco', took this game to its threshold
Best flow I bet the whole U.S. know
Try to make it like you the realest, but who the illest?
Think we all know the answer to that, cause niggas feel this right

[Puff Daddy]
You think I'ma come this far, and let you niggas s  me now?
I hate you too!!    (Do it now!)

[Base Chorus]

[3rd Chorus: add Puff Daddy after each pause]
I won't s 
I can't s 
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Puff] I like this.. I like the way this feels


It's a thin line between paper and hate
friends and snakes, nine millis and thirty-eights
Hell or the pearly gates; I was destined to come
Predicted, blame God, he blew breath in my lungs
Second to none, wicked turn wives to widows
Shoot through satin pillows, the desolate one
Took a little time to claim my spot
Chairman of the board until this game s , and I side with the Lord
Ride for the cause while drivin niggas shot at my doors
Plottin I'm sure to catch me with they glocks to my jaws
Tried, stickin me up, but I flipped on these ducks (you tried)
Instead of me, ambulances were picking them up (that's what you get)
Niggas fear what they don't understand, hate what they can't conquer
Guess it's just the fury of man
Became a monster, on   of the world, never fallin
I'm as real as they come, from day one, forever ballin
C'mon

[Puff Daddy]
You ain't never seen a nigga like me, ever in your life
And that's what you can't understand!

[Base Chorus]

[4th Chorus: start w/ Puff Daddy, then after each pause]
You can hate me now
I won't s 
I can't s 
You can hate me
I hate you too
You can hate me now..
You can hate me now..

[Puff] You can hate me now
    niggas
[Puff] But I won't s  now
  Do it now! Get   shit over with
[Puff] But I won't s  now..
  It   gon' never s  niggas
[Puff] I can't s ..




 
See no evil.. fear no evil.. speak no evil.. hear no evil..
If you don't bring that shit around you
You ain't got nuttin to worry about (uh-huh)
Yeah (yeah, uh-huh)
Knah-sayin?

Yo, yo yo yo
Carolyn, from Maryland, she Lady Heroin
She elegant -- her apparel in the M-Class caravan
Ki's of dope, lovin cats to ski in her dope
She f*ck killers in her condo, her Benz and her boat
Her iced throat, ass is curvy, 40 years old
She passin for 30, Gucci framed glasses from Purvy's
Madison Ave., shoppin when she not, coppin bricks of that shit
She hoppin on dicks, ridin Pony's who trick
At my man's wake, she said the eulogy
After that I usually, bumped into her shoppin for jewerly
Her bodyguard screwin me, I gave her my math
Ain't nothin new to me, blowin backs out, six-pack Stout's
Wide fat mouth, the evil look, with a bow-leg
Yo niggaz said, "Shorty's a pro, she blow heads
She push the fo' red, she know Feds, Feds know her"
A code red, maybe she's out to slay me, this bitch is crazy
She blew the celly up, meet me at the telly to f*ck
She knew about, cats from way back, we smoke the haystack
She never cough once, blunts was her hobby
She said I knew her man probably, no doubt, not since he tried to rob me
I jetted though, sometimes you never know
He snorted all her work, now she need me, to do her dirty work

It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
Yo it's a small world
Watch what you do..    ("It's a.. small world..")

Snook from Redhook was grimy, did five years, glad to be home
from Attica known, for keepin chrome calibers
Smooth like a Wallaby shoe, he's out to get it
Five years plannin to blow, soon as he hit the bri-dicks
Had a girl in Woodside Queens, thought he was low
Played the crib for a month, and deaded his P.O.
Started robbin niggaz til he caught a whole kilo
He had a bunch of starvin niggaz he owe, he never paid though
Got large, sign on his door, "Don't knock hard"
Layin with his bitch, niggaz is rich, is what he told her
Played the block, holdin cracks inside the baby stroller
Here come his crazy soldier, six shots it's over
A year went past, Snook went flossin fast
His old man had crossed his ass, for the laws of this fast cash

It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you don't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
where beef could never end
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again nigga
It's a small world, no doubt ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Watch what you do..    ("It's a.. small world..")

I seen death, seen thugs cry, it's bugged why
we let the slugs fly, enter your brain, through your skull
Another thug died, pitchin your soul, into that infinite
black hole, where many souls go cause of a fo'-fo' blast
Snook was one of em, so many more
Even that Fendi whore, got niggaz hit up yeah let that Henny pour
Carolyn, paid-up bitch, made bitch, stay rich
Heard her bodyguard took Snook to God
Carolyn when she needed him, he took the job
He was close to her, ever since she took him inside
When his moms died, dopefiend OD-ed, eighty-five
He went crazy, stuck up banks, to stay alive
He was live - do niggaz even know the things that he tried
Robbed armored trucks - incidents where po-lice died
He stayed in lower Eastside, peace God (peace God)
He starin at me hard
Two of his mans with him, I got to hit em
I'm reachin for my Roscoe, cocked it back on, and get my blast on
At the gas station, bunch of Arabs racin
out the way, as my Torah spray, jump in the whip
Hit the highway, you know how I say, the game that I play
It's real tendencies, when you feel your enemies
but can't figure out whose who, keep it true
Shit is cool now -- put the tools down?    Never
Cause everyday is on, livin this life, out for this cheddar

It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
Nigga you reap what you sew
What goes around, comes around
If you sleep you won't know
A very small world ("It's a.. small world..")
where beef, never ends
At the time you least expect it
I'ma see you again
It's a small world ("It's a.. small world..")
You get away with it now
Soon enough it catches up to you
Someway, somehow
It's a small world
Watch what you do.. ("It's a.. small world..")

("I'm going to see you again..
Uh-huh.. I'm going to see you again.. nigga..
Uh-huh.. going to see you again nigga.. yeah..")


[Scarface]
Yo Nas..
I don't think they wanna F*CK with this
Gangsta shit.. fo' sho'
("Danger.. danger..")

Check it out
It's on, and once again I bring niggaz the rough
F*ckin with us, that get you motherf*ckers touched
Hit in the darkest alleys, where the super sports Rally
Beatin up the block, leavin these motherf*ckers shot
They ain't ready for the Nakamici
I flip this shit like I'm Kamaneze
Now dey a motherf*ckin see me
They try to breeze me, but I got niggaz in New York 
comin kama-kize, sparkin this shit that keep me off the heezee
Jay-Hovah, he with my man came over
to scoop me, blowin dukey, in the black Range Rover
Nasir, tell these motherf*ckers what we came for
Tell these niggaz why we here

 
Nuttin but the New York to Texas connection
Nuttin but some real shit, what y'all expected
Spaz out, some times dreamin, think I'm awoke
Harsh realities of life, hit me after I smoke
Money satisfy half of my mood, then there's a part of me 
that's distant, quiet, the most dangerous side of me
I'm twisted like, Dr. Death, Kevorkian
Flip shit, white gun handle, made of porcelain
My, Houston niggaz, come through for niggaz
Scarface get a call and we shootin niggaz
Favor, for a favor, that's how we do business
Tryin to make future figures, we two of the illest, what?

[Chorus: Nas]

You wet who I want wetted, I'll wet who you want wetted
Any nigga can get it (a favor for a favor)    [3X]
I'll wet who you want wetted, you wet who I want wetted
Any nigga can get it

[Scarface]
You say you got a problem?    Then tell a nigga where he at
So I can study his motions and peel his motherf*ckin cap
Where his brother go to school at?    Find out some more information 
bout that bitch and hit a nigga right back
Cause when it come down to the come down;
I'ma pull the motherf*ckin plug on him
Walk up to his face and then gone
Set a example, send these hoes a little message:
They need to be more careful who they mess with, don't even stress it
Leaded, I pull these capers all the time
With the ugliest AK, I blow his motherf*ckin mind
Him and whoever standin by, I'll tell these niggaz, "Let's go"
And then we fin' to ride, and he fin' to die
He fin' to die, throwin up his own blood
With a slug in his motherf*ckin mug
I do this outta love, cause your money ain't no good here
Just consider that as favor, until I need a favor



 
A killer code, secret untold, how we bury beef with a rose
To his wake we send a wreath that explodes
Beneath us sleep with the Reaper, they sleep eyes closed
That's how real Brad Jordan keep it, to him I owe
Five fo-fo's ready, five masks, five mercedes
Attack em like Freddie, then we toastin over spaghetti
I share withcha drama, you share with mine
That's how we killin two birds at the same time
Send my enemy's ear, I'll send your enemy's finger
with a pinkie ring, that's just a present my nigga
Either way the heat is grave, f*ck with 'Face we bring war
Either, you feel these bullets or the Texas chainsaw
Not for popularity reasons, but for the love of the art
And you my heart, I leave casualties bleedin
Cause we keep it death for a death, life for a life
Murder for a murder, and I got you it's vice versa





Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

 
To my dogs.. wherever you are

Whattup Big?    You know shit is rough after you slid
You in God's hands now, keep a place for me kid
Ain't nuttin changed -- still _Party and Bullshit_
We used to +F*ck R&B Bitches+ and see who rhyme sickest
For every hit you made, more rappers afraid to come out
_Machine Gun Funk_, from Queens I came through to smoke blunts
You came to my hood, we was broke
I wonder if we stayed that way, would there have been gunsmoke?
Still on the block around fiends numb from coke, I guess so
Cause now with paper, shit is still ghetto
But f*ck it black, you livin your life, though your loved ones
Peace to your daughter and your newborn son
It used to be fun, makin records to see your response
But, now competition is none, now that you're gone
And these niggaz is wrong -- usin your name in vain
And they claim to be New York's king?    It ain't about that
It's more serious, I plan to toast it up with you
Joke with you, happy we on  , the most official
Ain't too many real ones out there; I feel some 
but doubt they're, capable, to take it where you took it to
I missed your wake not cause I'm fake
cause I hate to see somebody so great in that way
I woulda stayed so long with so much to say
I had to put it in writin to keep me and Brooklyn from fightin
Tellin me to pay my respects and move to the side
But I probably wouldn't have got off my knees to let people by
You can't kill nothin that's _Ready to Die_
You was like God to us in the form of Allah

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

 
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

Thug Life never die..

Dear 'Pac, every thug sheds a tear drop -- and use teeth 
to bite off beer  s, and _Pour Out a Lil' Liquor_
You was more than just the wildest nigga
+2Pacalypse+, I understand your style nigga
It's goin on the third year, since you've been gone
On the East and West Coast the same shit is goin on
The industry be talkin, offendin me often
They don't believe you dead, wanna see you in your coffin
I can relate, shootouts and court dates
+All Eyez on You+, niggaz in your face invadin your space
You asked if I could trade in your place, how would I hold up?
How long would I ride, before I fold up?
How did you know through your rhymes it was your time to go?
You predicted it in every line, all in your flow
There could _Never Be Peace_ I have to quote
Can't believe I heard my name on "the realest shit you ever wrote"
We had words cause the best supposed to clash at the  
but kept it brotherly, when we seen each other and s ped
in NYC, at MTV, people watched
We was both deep, after you left, I got no sleep
Think about how us real niggaz would be
If we united, a nation of thugs, who could fight it?
You was caught in a wild homicide, or were you crucified
like the son of God, when Lucifer lied
and make the world think, young blacks should be extinct?
But Thug Life'll never die, we stay high and just link
Will there ever be another MC as nice?
Will you return to us like the resurrection of Christ?

Still somehow I believe, we always survive.. but why?

 
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive

I wonder what the Commodores went through on tour?
Did Smokey Robinson, have to shoot his way out a war?
What has Al Green seen, that made him religious?
Was it the drugs -- put an end to the music business?
If so, should I put out the indo right now and write down
a plan and pursue my dream turn my life around
Cause I'm bound for the movie screen, cuties that scream
I'll need a extra Uzi riding through my own hood in Queens
It be the ones you always knew, that want it on
Tellin everybody it was him, that you fronted on
Thought we walked a million miles it was just twenty
Not used to walkin in the path of legit money
I thought I made it but we only took baby steps
Up the success ladder, where they pay me checks
To my clicks when I got it I said "Baby bless"
That was the 80's, but now look at this crazy mess
We in the 90's, and finally it's lookin good
Hip-hop took it to billions, I knew we would
A lot of ups and downs in the game, could lose or gain
a couple pounds tryin to maintain -- one day you here
the next you not; when you around niggaz, check 'em out
Some is bout it, most individuals plots
and run the spots, some choose to stay to theyselves
While others have no cares and stay in jail
More than fifty percent of us
endin up with holes through the chest
through the head, through the gut it shows
The future for us young shooters and old killers
Who become rich as dope dealers?
Nothing left for us but hoop dreams and hood tournaments
Thug coaches with subs sittin on the bench; either that or rap
We want the fast way outta this trap
Whether it be 9 to 5 or slangin crack
To my deceased Gods wishin I could bring you back
But life is a dream and y'all taught me that

.. always survive.. but why?

 
Always survive, always
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my people just stay alive
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive (no matter what)
Still, we, will survive
No matter what, my niggaz just stay alive




 
Uhh.. regulate nigga
Bravehearts nigga
Live for this
Some of y'all don't live at all
Get yours nigga
Get yours baby
Uhh, yo.. yo..

As the night close down on the Earth like gray dark rings
Light of cities in the nights, destination for Kings
with big dreams, like Castro, overthrew Bautista
from Cuba, and pointed nukes toward the U.S.
About to shoot us for revolution; that's how you gotta move
A lot of rules, some locked in solitude
Curse the day of they birth confused, who's to be praised?
The mighty dollar -- or almighty Allah
I'm like the farmer, plantin words, people are seeds
My truth is the soil; help you grow like trees
May the children come in all colors, change like leaves
but hold before you, one of those, prophetic MC's
with blunted flows, seven hundred souls in me
Each channelin, from past to present times, heaven shines
light on those, innocent to how the world grows
Some men become murderers, and some girls become hoes
And you accounted for, everything that you heard
Do not speak to fools; they scorn the wisdom of your words
My heart is wise, bloodshot eyes, the saga never dies
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

Yo we gotta be God's children, habitats in tall buildings
Rats crawl in filthy hallways, incinerators
Sinners who faithless, still there's hope, pray it's answered
Dreams turned real - what's a wicked nation?
One with blind men - not takin charge of the situation
Empty arguments and real conversations needed
The world'll need it, to hear it
Evil tries to weaken my spirit - it's chronic herb
This hurt come from the honest word
I now try hardest to serve my maker, what I learned
find it's way on the paper, so I could dictate it
Articulate it, luckily - I was put on one of the ships that made it
through strong currents and winds that left the others stranded
to sink in the Atlantic
Satan jigs the planet, not to get too religious, but
who decides when and if your life is finished?
If Christ is in this, for the sake of your name, oh Lord
may we break away from the chains abroad

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..

You wanna buy time?    I'm the seller of minutes
I give you every second low-priced, if I so lies; the truth is
Time waits for none of you, in fact
he can't wait for the date to snatch the ground right from under you
Small visions of better life if cheddar was right
lurk in the mind, of young ones ahead of they time
Trapped in the slums, beggin for nuttin but takin
Headed for nuttin but the state pen, where they cousins be waitin
Judges is not relatin to pleas, guns bustin where the kids play
Richochet off lamp poles and leave damp holes
in bystanders, get cancelled, D.O.A.
Around the way where we from
Hope the future reduce the rate of those buried young
Life is every man's kingdom, a dyin man's past
and a newborn's, first time to be here at last
And shouldn't have to grow up fast, and suffer our pain
Hustlin harder than the generations here before he came
Goin through the same bullshit as our fathers
Readin history, but who's the authors?
For some the game is easy, for most of us the game is much harder
But never lose faith; through the years just get smarter
Ghetto prisoners.. ghetto prisoners..

Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners.. get up, wake up, rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners rise rise rise
Ghetto prisoners..




[Nas + (Timbaland)]
(What?)    Ever been in love?    (C'mon)
Yeah.. are you ready? (uhh) For somethin real?
(Say what?)    Cause it can't be fake
This ain't no game    (C'mon)
You gotta be wit me, for real (uh-huh)
cause it's real out here (uh-huh)
So make up your mind, cause I ain't got no time 
Y'know?    (C'mon)

 
I'm the most wanted baby fathe, save the drama 
We toast when I wine and dine ya -- all you need is me
I won't stress you but bless you
Mentally and sexual, we both intellectual
Can't forget how I met you;
you thought I was a boxer -- Prince Nasim
but I'm the mobster -- Nas from Queens
And when I gotcha - you ridin with me
You keep askin, "When do you have time for me?"
I'm never free always on the move, bidness oriented
Lifestyle expensive, attract women 
You wanna search my pockets, and act all wild 
Say I hurt your heart - ask how could I smile?
Wanna call back all my numbers - star 6-9 me
Check my car for rubbers, but quit tryin
before you find what you lookin for and get to cryin
You always sayin what you gon' do if you catch me lyin

[Chorus One: Aaliyah + (Timbaland) + {Nas}]

You won't see me tonight {Yeah right} (Say what? Say what?)
You won't see me tomorrow {uh-huh} (uh-huh)
I'll be gone by daylight {Doubt that} (What?)
And you'll be so full of sorrow {Yeah right}
You'll go tell all your friends {That's right} (Say what?)
how you called and I follow {They know it}
But you won't see me tonight {You don't believe that}
No you won't see me tomorrow

 
Caramel kisses of Jezebel's sister 
I feel no guilt when I twist ya 
Turn the other cheek when I see the next freak witcha
You got your name on his lease, copy his key 
That's your lil' spot where you rest your wig peice
Go 'head and live baby, I know you his lady
You page me, when you got the day free
but I be out with my peeps in them system jeeps
You wanna lay up in the sheets of presidential suites
like I'll massage you while you massage me, mami
But can you hang with a young man who's doin his thang?
Speak up, I wanna know if you can keep up
Timberland boots for girls, with the tree stump
Baggy sweatsuits, mystery what's underneath them
They for my eyes only, you call me when you lonely 
but I like to make the baddest girls wait, I got G baby

[Interlude: Nas and Aaliyah]

['Yah] Call you on a Monday
    call you back baby    
['Yah] Call you on a Tuesday
  My   is off baby
['Yah] Call you on a Wednesday
  I'm out of   baby
['Yah] You won't be back til Thursday
    page you back baby
['Yah] Call you on a Monday
       call you back baby    
['Yah] Call you on a Tuesday
  I'm out of   baby
['Yah] Call you on a Wednesday
  My   is off baby
['Yah] You won't be back til Thursday
    call you back baby

[Chorus Two: Aaliyah + (Timbaland)]

You won't see me tonight (Say what?)
You won't see me tomorrow (Say what?)
I'll be gone by daylight
And you'll be so full of sorrow
You'll go tell all your friends (What what?)
how you called and I follow (Say what?)
But you won't see me tonight
No you won't see me tomorrow

 
Thinking of me you gettin the chills
Like a rush through your body when you think how it feels
Give me a call and my voice give you butterflies in your tummy
Tell your friends you in love with Nas not his money
And I'll prove I'm a man of my word - handed you furs
Iceberg - everything on this planet Earth a woman desires
You make a good wife to most men
I know I got you open; but -- you just my close friend
Get it baby?

[Chorus Three: Aaliyah + (Timbaland) + {Nas}]

You won't see me tonight (uh-huh)
You won't see me tomorrow (Say what?)
I'll be gone by daylight {Dayyyy-light}
And you'll be so full of sorrow {.. Word?}
You'll go tell all your friends {Tell your friends what?} (Say what?)
how you called and I follow {Uhh, uhh}
But you won't see me tonight {Not tonight baby}
No you won't see me tomorrow

[Nas + (Aaliyah)]
The God, The God, The God, Nasir (You won't see me tonight)
The Queen, The Queen, The Queen, Aaliyah (You won't see me tomorrow)
Nah nah (I'll be gone by daylight)
(And you'll be so full of sorrow)
Uhh uhh (You'll go tell all your friends)
Tell your friends (how you called and I followed)
How you followed me (But you won't see me tonight)
Not tonight baby (No you won't see me tomorrow)
C'mon, c'mon c'mon
Tomorrow, what?
Daylight, ghost

[Timbaland + (Aaliyah)]
Say what, say what?    Yo (You won't see me tonight)
You won't see Timbaland tonight baby
Ohhh, or Nas Esco', check it
Let it ride

[Chorus: repeat 2X]

I wanna talk to the mayor, the governor, the motherf*ckin president
I wanna talk to the FBI, and the CIA, and the motherf*ckin congressman

 
Step up to the White House let me in
Whats my reason for being I'm ya next to kin
And we built this motherf*cker
You wanna kill me because my hunger?
Mr. America young black niggaz want ya
I wanna talk to the man understand
Understand this motherf*ckin G-pack in my hand
Look what happened to San Fran young girl hit by policeman
Twelve shots up in her dome, damn
Niggaz thought we slept but the architect sent
The Pentagon's from Egypt, government secret
The 99 to 2-G computer shutdown, what now
Extension on Earth, human cutdown
Niggaz play with PlayStations, they build a spacestations
On Mars plottin civilizations
Dissin us discriminatin different racisis
Tax payers pay for more jail for black latin faces



 
I'm just a black man why y'all made it so hard damn
Niggaz gotta go create their own job
Mr. Mayor imagine if this was your backyard
Mr. Governor imagine if it was your kids that starved 
Imagine your kids gotta sling crack to survive
Swing a mack to be live    cart ack to get high
It's the ghetto life yea I celebrate it I live it
And all I got is what you left me with I'ma get it
Now y'all combinin all the countries we goin do the same
Combine all the cliques to make one gang
It ain't all about a black and white thing
it's to make the change, citizens of a higher plane



 
What y'all waitin for the world to blow up
Before you hear this rewind this 4 minutes before we timeless
Let y'all niggas bang my shit before ? is
The Nastradamus tell us what time it is
They try to buy us with doe
Fake black leaders of puppets always talking bout the city budget
The news got it all confused lyin to the public
They eyes watchin stay wise move above it
Water floods predicted hurricanes twisters
Its all signs of the Armageddon three sixes
People reverse the system politics verse religion
Holy war muslim verse christians
Niggaz in high places they don't have the balls for this
People in power sit back and watch them slaughter us
Mr. President I assume it was negligence
The streets upside down, I'm here to represent this

[Chorus 2X]

 
Can I talk to you Mr. President
Niggaz tryin to get with the computers
We ain't John Henry
Banging down machines and shit
Part of establishment
That's what we are steppin up for
This shit is real

Total Package in this nigga
LES in this nigga
Ill Will nigga
Mr. President wanna keep us from establishment 
Niggaz are american baby
American Made










Hell yeah
Check it check it check, check check
Yo, when it come to sex advice, I'm the one to call
if you a virgin with blue balls or you tear down walls
Not Dr. Ruth, call me Dr. Knockboot
Pimped out hats, rock fashionable suits
A class for the youth, Sex Ed for your head
The do's and don'ts, that should happen in the bed
First, DON'T: run up in her raw cause you get burned
for sure, f*ckin with the typical whore, because
DO: rock a Rough Ryder, whenever you inside her
Your local bodega is your supplier
And DON'T: take the pussy, if she fightin
Cause you saw what happened to Tupac and Mike Tyson
'Specially if you large, some hoes is trife
Get you on a rape charge, have you servin your life
Yo, DO: get a yes confirmation before penetration
You wind up in a police station
DON'T: get with no young bitch and hit it
She PG-13, you rated R, she not permitted
DO: check for ID, whenever chillin V.I.P. 
with fly shorty P.Y.T.
Yo, DON'T: lie about the cars you got 
or who you hang with, frontin when you borrowed your watch
Yo, DO: play your game right, if the G's tight
then you can f*ck shorty the same night
Yo, DON'T: trick when you don't have to
You think you ballin?    You turn your back they laffin at you
You don't gotta keep repeatin you a thug, she heard you
In fact, she attracted to your man that herbed you
DO: spend a lil' dough, only if you know
the bitch gross a lil' somethin too bro
DON'T: eat the pussy the first night
Maker her bless you, we call that shit gesundheit
DO: set the mood right, Bailey's with ice
A cup of Thug Passion'll make everything right
Yo, DON'T: pop shit like you Daddy Longdick
when you come fast like Fed-Ex and bust too quick
DO: hit positions she will find interest in
DON'T: hit the pussy if that shit's blisterin
Hope you're listenin, turn up your transisterin
Hot 97, KISS-FM
or B-L-S, with your hand up her dress
Chillin with your girl while you thinkin bout ya ex

Problems or questions, I can answer them best

ltl2('Nas','Dr. Knockboot')


 
Yo ill will, ruff ryders
what what, sraight like that

You a killer or a hustler, dealer or customer
Gangsta or buster, youngster or old nigga
A weed head, a coke sniffer
You rich or a broke nigga
Know you all relate to this shit that i wrote niggas
Lots of my mans trapped up in a max
Penatentary, sending me letters i answer back
That eventually, we all be bentley'ed out
Throwing campaigns, f*ck it I'm running for White House
My niggas control Senate, pipe seats jeeps tinted
Mad Lewinsky chicks, some kinky shit
Did dirt now I knew it would come back one day
So I'm on point, scrap, prepare for gunplay
Stared at one face, thought it was beef he looked familiar
Ready to blast ,nigga gave me daps said I feel ya
Can't believe how my life changed
From the hood, the first time in my life I can say i did the right thing

[Chorus: 4x]
Life is what you make it nigga, I'ma make it
No matter what it takes my nigga, we gonna take it(uh)

[DMX]
uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Everyday shit, around the way shit got me stressed (what)
So i keep on the vest in case a nigga wanna    test (uh)
I got no time for games cause I'm all grown up
You wanna joke nigga? laugh when you get blown up (come on)
See how funny it is when your kids aint got no father
Cause you played it sweet now you floating in the harbor (for real)
Shit is hectic so respect it for your health (what)
Didn't think it was right, you should've checked it yourself (come on)
Life is too short to get caught up in some dumb shit
Wake up one day, 40 years old on some bumb shit
Time flew by, you was too fly to see the light
Everyday it's getting darker then comes the night
Now what? (what) realize that you ain't got shit (uh)
Not long ago you was the man on some hot shit
So just peep the flow yo, cause you already in this
Make sure your shit is right kid and handle your business (uh huh)



 
Make history before you go
F*ck the misery, you po we gettin doe
Except the ?dollars? other reasons why I'm living yo (why?)
Time is viable
Low and behold the young, black, and powerful
Got to eat yo, everyday my daughters feet grow
You wack and cheap with the doe, my heat could blow
Payin doctors when I'm born, a preacher when I'm buried
That's why cash is needed for my kids to inherit
Gotta pay just for living, tax life is a b'ness (business)
If you catch a bad deal, watch your life deminish
Deals made by God and the Devil, and we in it
Pawns in the game, can't complain or say shit
Just strap up and hold on, hope for the best
prepare for the worse, no fears no nothing on earth
No tears if I'm dumped in a hearse, I won't be the first
Nor the last nigga, let's get this cash nigga


Get yours nigga
Cuz Imma get mine
In due time
Everybody gotta shine
Get yours, I spray nines
I say this one time
The last time, I swear to ya'll
I'm from where
The dope fiends is at
And killas crawl
And snitches call police
All these niggas and street
Corners everybody's like
Smokin' marijuana and
Snuffin' niggas in faces & startin' drama and
Shootin' niggas in cold blood, just kill 'em, so what
With the fo' pound go nuts
Betta slow up
Before you get your ass on up
Nigga never gonna grow up
Drinkin' the Henney
But her know he gonna throw up
Tryin' to make crack sales
What it look like? The future for a black male
Don't want to make my momma cry
On a front page for a homicide
Fly whips, all I wanted to drive
Where chicks get blunted & ride
Do 105 in the fast lane
And a fast pace chasin' the papas
Spendin' chips on big chains
And the dimes that give brains
That was a 80's and 90's thing
Now I'm into big things

[1st Chorus]
I ain't f*ck with you
Now I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
Cuz now I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna rhyme wit you
Cuz now I'm into big things
You know I can't do that shit no more
Now I'm into big things

Nah, I can't f*ck with you
I'm into big things
Nah, I ain't gonna stand on the corner
I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things


When I started this
All I wanted was cars and cribs
Like other rap artists but
Do I know where I'm goin' to?
Can I forget when I came from?
I be showin' you
Another style Imma flow for you
Can I make somethin' wild
I can throw for you, flow for you
Make it bi-coastal
Take it to heights
That some of ya'll can't come close to?
Some of ya'll 
Want to talk like hoes
Worse than bitches
And when ya'll niggas see me blow
Bet it hurt like stitches
No competition
I s  and twist 'em
Hit 'em like a mafia proposition
I'm glad ya'll s ped and listen
Thinkin' back to when I had not pot to piss in
Look up at a nigga nod
Rocks are glistenin'
Can't s  my mission
Make anotha LP drop
I'm hittin'
With the new shit exclusive
No time to get caught up in a crime
I ain't have shit to do with
Used to chase the hoes
Now I chase the dough
Is ya'll bitches gonna help me get paper?
No!

[1st Chorus]


I go past ya'll
Ya'll got the glass jar
And when I hit it, admit it
Ya'll on ya'll ass ya'll
We on the same team
You don't wanna pass the ball
Chuck and gun up the dough
You want to score
But you really don't want to ball
I put you on
It was me that introduced you to wealth
Crossin' me
Is like shootin' yourself
Wanna blow so fast now do it yourself
You ain't shit now
You was so ill, why you never came out
Where ya clique now
Where you sit now
In the back seat
Mad cuz I flip styles
And I pack heat
Make you run laps
Like a pro athlete
An' I done that
From my experiences
I appear relentless
Take more time
Just to hear my sentence
Imma tell you what's real
An' what could s  you from makin' a mil
You could prevent this
When niggas don't see eye to eye to you
Lie to you
Wanna get high wit you
Want to eat food off of your labor
And take food off your table
Cuz they don't see your vision
Don't understand your mission
Is to make history
While you here
How long you plan on livin'
Not for forever
At least to 140
Pray for me
I'm tryin' to eat
Like the niggas who bought
Motown on Berry Gordy
Good God

[2nd Chorus]
Nigga I'm tired of games
I'm into big things
Gotta get my life together man
Cuz now I'm into big things
Now the talk is small talk
Cuz now I'm into big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things

Man we already did that
Now I'm into big things
No time to get sidetracked
Now I'm into big things
Get money now besides that
Some more big things
I'm into big things
The big things
The big things






"Nas is . . ." - [Nas (7x)]

 
Freedom or jail, clips inserted, a baby's bein born
Same time my man is murdered, the beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also, what defines my name
First it was Nasty, but times have changed
Ask me now, I'm the artist, but hardcore, my science for pain
I spent time in the game, kept my mind on fame
Saw fiends shoot up, and do lines of cocaine
Saw my close friends shot, flatline am I sane?
That depends, carry Mac-10's to practice my aim
On roof s, tape cd covers to trees
Line the barrel up with your weak picture then squeeze
Street scriptures for lost souls, in the crossroads
To the corner thugs hustlin for cars that cost dough
To the big dogs livin large, takin it light
Pushin big toys, gettin nice, enjoyin your life
is what you make it, suicide, few try to take it
Belt tied around they neck in jail cells naked
Heaven and hell, rap legend, presence is felt
And of course N - A - S are the letters that spell . . . 
NAS, NAS

[Chorus: scratching by DJ Premier (2X)]

"Nas is like life or death.. I'm a rebel.. "
"My poetry's deep, I never fell.."
"Nas is like.. half man half amazing.."
"No doubt.."

 
"Nas is like.."    Earth Wind & Fire, rims and tires
Bulletproof glass, inside is the realest driver
Planets in orbit, line em up with the stars
Tarot cards, you can see the pharaoh Nas
"Nas is like.."    Iron Mike, messiah type
Before the Christ, after the death
The last one left, let my cash invest in stock
Came a along way from blastin, techs on blocks
Went from Seiko to Rolex, ownin acres
From the projects with no chips, to large cake dough
Dimes, givin fellatio, siete zeros
Bet my nine spit for the pesos
But what's it all worth, can't take it when you under this Earth
Rich men died and tried, but none of it worked
They just rob your grave, I'd rather be alive and paid
Before my number's called, history's made
Some'll fall, but I rise, thug or die
Makin choices, that determine my future under the sky
To rob steal or kill, I'm wondering why
It's a dirty game, is any man worthy of fame?
Much to success to ya, even if you wish me the opposite
Sooner or later we'll all see who the prophet is



 
"Nas is like.."    Sex to a nympho, but nothin sweet
I'm like beef, bustin heat through your windows
I'm like a street sweeper, greenleaf reaper
Like Greeks in Egypt, learnin somethin deep from they teachers
I'm like crime, like your nine, your man you would die for
Always got you, I'm like Pop Duke you would cry for
I'm like a whole lot of loot, I'm like crisp money
Corporate accounts from a rich company
I'm like ecstasy for ladies, I'm like all races
combined in one man; like the '99 summer jam
Bulletproof Hummer man
I'm like being locked down around new faces, and none of em fam'
I'm the feelin of a millionaire spendin a hundred grand
I'm a poor man's dream, a thug poet
Live it, and I write down and I watch it blow up
Y'all know what I'm like, y'all play it your system every night
Now..


Picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
I remember the first time, girl you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G
Girl picture us married, you and me; K-I-S-S-I-N-G 
I remember the first time, girl you and me; F-U-C-K-I-N-G

 
She was the modern Isis, honey thought she was priceless
Perfect definition what a wife is, I like this
Showed me how excitin life is
I used to hang around dudes that used ice picks
The sheistiest, put you on they heist list
How we met it must have been fate
First date, crushed grapes, we ate lobster and steak
She kept asking questions how the cash made how my rent's paid
How many guns I sprayed and huns I laid
She said she want to have a family raise kids someday
Like out in Beverly Hills she wanna live one day
I can get with that I drop you off home 
I call you hit me back
I wanna dig that and did I? I did that
Put it way up where her ribs at, her future kids had
You held out for two weeks, longer than these hoodrats
You precious more precious than lost treasure
Matter of fact I'm kinda hopin we can stay together



 
I see you dressed up in white face covered in vail
Do I hear wedding bells?    My dogs throwin rice
And it's the day that your father give you away
to a real man that gently put the ring on your hand 
Do we vow to stay faithful? Do more than try to
Now, look me in my eyes and say I do
Drivin off in the Rolls Royce just married on the plates
We can spend our honeymoon in the states
You can throw your friend the bouquet
Somethin in the back of my head say
For us two, maybe cuz I love you
Hug you squeeze you touch you tease you 
As long as we together it's heaven for me to please you
Won't s  til I tell you me to beautiful
Deeper and harder love layin new with you
Runnin my fingers through your hair it's like days can go by
while I'm wit you and I won't even care, word



 
She been with young dudes, old guys, Hindus, pa-pi's
Colombians who cut pies, but none of them can touch Nas
Thug ones to those soft as baby shit
She been with hoodlums and those who had crazy chips
Til one day she decided to flip
It was nuttin I can do about it, like she the boss and shit
Started talkin this divorcin shit
I gave her my half rib, half my crib, half my cake 
Half my car, half my kids?    Can't get that 
Tried to swing on the God, had to dip that
Yo, push her on the bed, lift her leg, had to rip that
All she wanted was rough sex, with her slick ass
Had to sit back, smoke a blunt and just look 
With her fine-ass body and a damn good cook
For some reason yo she had me stuck and I had her in my web too
You my queen God bless you

[Chorus 2X to fade]



[kissing]
I love you so much, dont never leave me, I wont let you leave

The ho turned me out, green eyes, had a crush on her
Since 5 years old, met her, fell in love wit her
I saved that ho cause she bring more hoes
She major yo, the way she left them other dudes cold
Heart-broken she walked right out of mad nigga's life
So when I bagged her up right, I had to make her my wife
And I aint gonna loose her like those other lames did
I keep a stash safe kid, when I proposed it made her face big
She keep me jigg, glorifying medallions
Got me in clothes made by Italians, feed me lobster and scallions
Watching her pile on my bed, her body feel stacked
She been around for years, know the hustlers, pimps, and macks
Bankers and diplomats
She the scratch on my back
Her c.r.e.a.m. I lust, now I got her I dont know how to act
When she not around, Im heated, bout' to lay somethin' flat
Know how to treat it, never take for granted, she got me trapped


My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money,
Yeah yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich

All the fun we have together, I keep you in my pocket
Its so much of you I share you, and speak to you in private
You got me karats on my wrist
Im a savage for your kiss
Embarrassed when Im not with you, Im off guard
Niggas always expect to see us 2 together, stable
The best couple they seen since Trump and Marla Maple
Dont need no pre-nup, 
Cause when we hump we do it up, make sure we both will bust a doller sign nut
Before I got to know, my life I say was mediocre
Break of day, slingin' all night long, fienin' to stroke ya
Seeing niggas wit' you I wasn't happy
Wanted to stick them up to get you, heard you calling for daddy
And gladly I take you as my lawfully wedded wife
Never divorce me, I promise to treat you right
Keep you satisfied, never lie help you grow
My legal tender, lovely federal reserve note


My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money, love her cause she keep a nigga rich
Ohhh money you my honey, but I think she got me pussy whipped
My money, money, money, my bitch is my money
Ohhh money you my honey
Money is my bitch
Ohhh money, money, money,
Yeah that bitch treat me like a trick
Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich

I wont sell my soul to you
What do I owe to you
My cars, my house, my flow to you
Screw you
Before you
Real niggas said I was cool, now I got you
The envy me cause I'm wit you
You floss too much
Turn niggas out, one touch
For you, my guns bust
You always said in GOD we trust
Its hard enough to keep counting on you
You cheat wit' government thugs, got the IRS pounding on you
I think I like'd you better when you where illegal
But you had to get professional
Musical
Now when we f*ck we use profalactic, hard plastic
Stick you in ATM's, limited cash quick
Said you'd give me luxuary, when I asked it
F*cking me, I gave you back shots in ya ASSets
Promised happiness, but really did nothing for me
I guess bitches like you just grow on trees

Ohhh money you my honey, she says without her I cant be rich





 
Uh..
Pacino life, G a roll, casino dice
at the Mirage, Vegas strip, neon lights
Gamblers, puffin cigars, couples and stars
Flashin cameras, dealers, shufflin cards
Spent the weekend, already miss New York and it's odd
cause I'm the first to say it got too many hustlers who rob
I never hang out, when we do we bust the four-five
cause shells comin back at us while we jump in the ride
Flyin, duckin, our bitches in the club cluckin
Tellin my wife who I was dancin with like I was f*ckin
Flew back, Monday evening from the bottom where the sun was beamin
to the concrete jungle of cement
Limousine's from LaGuardia airport, sleepin
Told my dogs peace, kept in movin, I was beat when
got to my crib, where the hell my keys went?
Ringin the bell, heard a yell but wasn't sure
Dropped my luggage to the ground, put my ear to the door
Slow music, H-Town, no that's down low
My baby's, drop Mercedes is parked, I creep around yo
to the back, she must be inside and can't hear
Probably upstairs, in the mirror, doin her hair
I walked in through the back door entrance
Shocked it was unlocked, when I walked in, I smelled incense
chased by a weed aroma, empty Guinnesses
and lipstick marks on like three empty Coronas
A pair of blue jeans on the carpet; size 12 Timberlands
Somethin swingin on the ceilin fan, I s ped it
Swingin slower and slower..
On the last swing I saw it was a G-string and heard laughin
Thought about my nine-side Glock but somethin made me disregard it
Started my way up to where the noise and music was at
Froze, I couldn't react
Bedroom door opened a crack, seen wifey layin with some nigga
mumblin shit, he had one hand on her ass
and she was rubbin his dick, toastin wine glasses
Cherry scented candles was lit, couldn't handle the shit
Searchin for words I found none, without a sound
I left the house with a sick smile and took my gun
Now I'm out buggin, whylin, what I'm gon do?
Call my man Horse, meet me outside, I'm comin through

[Nas singing]
I thought you loved me
I thought you cared for me
I thought you needed me
Did you believe in me?    [repeat 2X]

 
Got up with Horse, showed a look on my face was mad lost
I ain't know whether to cry or just, try to laugh it off
"Son you home early -- they wiped you out that quick?"
I said, "Nah," showed him the plastic with nine in the clip
Hopped in the whip, popped in the disc, pressed play
To the Grand Central, from the Van Wyck Expressway
I said, "Bet you'll never guess in a million years
what I just saw happenin -- and probably still is
Snuck in my crib - some nigga f*ckin my wiz
I saw dem, they ain't see me, I ducked and I slid
I'ma grab shorty, I need you to grab the nigga for me"
Just when I thought I found love, she shitted on me
Shopped in Vegas, a present, for our engagement
20 G's on a ring I would have hit her today with
My surprise couldn't match the one she had for me
We pulled up, he was walkin out the house backwardly
Parked in the back of my house, they couldn't see us
Ran to the side of my house, cocked the heater
Walked to the front when I talked he had junk
Bitch tried to slam the door shut, got caught in Horse foot
Shot the Spanish kid in the rib, drug him in
Grabbed her face, say goodbye to your undercover friend
One between the eye, she's died, by mistake
Must've held the gat too tight, pointed at her face
Heard somebody knock -- Horse helped me hide the bodies
Heard si-rens, I guess we goin out we out like kamikazes
We surrounded, red lights flashin, who's inside?
Came out a bullhorn, I'm contemplatin suicide
Horse asked me for the Mac, he gave me dap, one love
Cocked the strap, then he ran out the back
Mad shots couldn't tell what was goin on
Sat on the floor near my dead girl, put her in my arms
Pulled her ring out my pocket I was savin
Put it on her ring finger cocked the glock, and started prayin
to Muhammad and Allah, the most beneficial
through you, all things are possible, I know you're listenin
I never meant for this to happen, I never dreamed
this'd be my fate, such a grotesque, murder scene
On that note, same time, the cops busted in
Kissed my lady, her blood on my lips, I said "Amen"
Put the nine to my head, pulled the hammer, held her close
Squeeze the toast, said to her, "Now unto God, we elope"

.. we elope ..

[cop says "stupid f*cking niggers" as he walks in]


[Nature]
Queensbridge, 41st side
Yo yo yo
I gots no birth records, no next of kin
Know a lot of mothaf*ckers, got no best friends
Know the weather checkin ten-ten winds a.m.
First and fifteenth I'm layin at the check cashing
Think I'm playin, blink and I'm sprayin
Wrong move, ask yourself what leg you wanna lose cuz you gon' lose
I cripple niggas, from the complex to simple niggas
Keep showin    y'all what difficult is
Half the world sayin "Dunn" but never been to the Bridge
What type of shit is that, fraudulence, what's the cause of it
Nature came threw erasing all of it, s  the presses
Goofy niggas ask a lot of questions
I repeat this is not a question
If you don't reply quick enough I gotta press em
Keep the glock by the intestines, .38 waist
Wit a belt, regardless of your stats you can catch a shell


Believe me when I tell you this (Believe me when I tell you this)
There's nuttin y'all can do for me (There's nuttin y'all can do for me)
I don't believe in selfishness, this time I want my crew to eat (My crew)
We comin through a hundred strong (Comin through a hundred strong)
We comin wit a hundred miles (A hundred miles)
Bumpin shit all summer long (Bump that)
We want it dead and want it now (We want it now)

Yo aiyyo I rap for my niggas and rap for the hoes
Rap when I'm gettin dressed, when I iron my clothes
Depressed, I kick raps that change your whole mood
And somehow stick to your ribs like soul food
Rap for wheelchairs, rap for canes
Ace bandages and niggas wit sprain, stay limpin in pain
I rap for math, english, even rap for science
Gotta try to laugh, keep myself from cryin
I rap for Giants, the Jets, the Yankees, the Mets
It's New York New York, from Clue to Flex
New cassettes stay poppin up, your boo let me throw my cock in her
Rappin got me two proper nuts
It's crazy, I even rap for high school coach
White folks fiend out like in Michael Doates
Creamed out, dope stashin
For those askin, I flow for TV, HBO and closed caption



Aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo aiyyo
Don't go to Texas, don't go to Watts
Don't go to Queensbridge, nigga don't go to cops
Don't snitch when you're gettin bagged
In the penns, don't bitch when you gettin stabbed
Just hold that, I pose for Kodak's, rose to stardom
Hoes in Harvard, sophmores get knocked off, nigga watch yours
I watch the game like it's Saint John's
It ain't wrong, take a blank piece of paper, a pen paint songs
Type colorful, writin that shit a thug'll do
In the heat of the moment, type to make a sudden move
Some'll snooze, some'll snore, they won't admit that dunn is pure
Once I quit, niggas wanted more
Cop my shit once it come in store
The first week be at the   of the charts, got it jumpin off
Hot verses wit a hundred thoughts
One theme, gettin caught in my zone you'll become a corpse

[Chorus 2x]

Fake thug, no love, you get the slug, CB4 Gusto
Your luck low, I didn't know til I was drunk though
You freak niggaz played out, get f*cked and ate out
Prostitute turned bitch, I got the gauge out
96 ways I made out, Montana way
The Good-F-E-L-L-A, verbal AK spray
Dipped attache, jumped out the Range, empty out the ashtray
A glass of 'ze make a man Cassius Clay
Red dot plots, murder schemes, thirty-two shotguns
Regulate wit my Dunn's, 17 rocks gleam from one ring
Yo let me let y'all niggaz know one thing
There's one life, one love, so there can only be one King
The highlights of livin, Vegas style roll dice in linen
Antera spinnin on Milleniums, twenty G bets I'm winnin them
Threats I'm sendin them, Lex with TV sets the minimum
Ill sex adrenaline
Party with villians, a case of Demi-Sec to chase the Henny
Wet any clique, with the semi-tech who want it
Diamonds I flaunt it, chickenheads flock I lace em
Fried broiled with basil, taste em, crack the legs
way out of formation, it's horizontal how I have em
f*ckin me in the Benz wagon
Can it be Vanity from Last Dragon
Grab your gun it's on though
Shit is grimy, real niggaz buck in broad daylight
with the broke Mac it won't spray right
Don't give a f*ck who they hit, as long as the drama's lit
Yo, overnight thugs, bug cause they ain't promised shit
Hungry-ass hooligans stay on that piranha shit

[Chorus: samples from "New York State of Mind" (repeat 4X)]

"I never sleep, cause sleep is the cousin of death" ->  
"I ain't the type of brother made for you to start testin" ->  

 
I peeped you frontin, I was in the Jeep
Sunk in the seat, tinted with heat, beats bumpin
Across the streat you was wildin
Talkin bout how you ran the Island in eighty-nine
Layin up, playin the yard with crazy shine
I cocked a baby 9 that nigga grave be mine, clanked him
What was he thinkin on my corner when it's pay me time
Dug em you owe me cousin somethin told me plug him
So dumb, felt my leg burn, then it got numb
Spun around and shot one, heard shots and dropped son
Caught a hot one, somebody take this biscuit 'fore the cops come
Then they came askin me my name, what the f*ck
I got stitched up and went through
Left the hospital that same night, what
Got my gat back, time to backtrack
I had to drop so how the f*ck I get clapped
Black was in the Jeep watchin all these scenes speed by
It was a brown Datsun, and yo nobody in my hood got one
That clown nigga's through, blazin at his crew daily
The 'Bridge touched me up severely hear me?
So when I rhyme it's sincerely yours
Be lightin L's sippin Coors, on all floors in project halls
Contemplatin war niggaz I was cool with before
We used to score together, Uptown coppin the raw
But uhh, a thug changes, and love changes
and best friends become strangers, word up

[Chorus: first from "New York State of Mind", then "Halftime" (repeat 4X)]

"Y'all know my steelo" ->  
"There ain't an army that could strike back" ->  

 
Thug niggaz
Yo, to them thug niggaz gettin it on in the world you know?
To them niggaz that's locked down
doin they thing survivin yaknowmsayin?
To my thorough niggaz, New York and world wide
Yo to the Queensbridge Militia
9-6 shit.. The Firm clique, Illmatic nigga
It Was Written though
It's been a long time comin
Y'all fake niggaz, tryin to copy
better come with the real though
Fake ass niggaz yo..
(They throw us slugs we throwin em back, what?)
Bring the shit man, live man
(F*ck that son)
Nine-six shit..




Uhh, what, what, uhh..

[Chorus: Nas (set to Eurythmics "Sweet Dreams")]

Street dreams are made of these
Niggaz push Beemers and 300 E's
A drug dealer's destiny is reachin a key
Everybody's lookin for somethin..
Street dreams are made of these
Shorties on they knees, for niggaz with big G's
Who am I to disagree?
Everybody's lookin for somethin..

 
My man put me up for the share, one-fourth of a square
Headed for Delaware, with one change of gear
Nothin on my mind but the dime sack we blazed
with the glaze in my eye, that we find when we crave
dollars and cents, a fugitive with two attempts
Jakes had no trace of the face, now they drew a print
Though I'm innocent, til proven guilty
I'ma try to filthy, purchase a club and start up realty
For real G, I'ma fullfill my dream
If I conceal my scheme, then precisely I'll build my cream
the first trip without the clique
Sent the bitch with the quarter brick, this is it
Fresh face, NY plates got a Crooked I for the Jakes
I want it all, ArmorAll Benz and endless papes
God sake, what nigga got to do to make a half million
without the FBI catchin feelings



 
From fat cat to papi, niggaz see the cat
Twenty-five to flat, push a thousand feet back
Holdin gats wasn't making me fat, snitches on my back
Livin with moms, gettin it on, flushin crack down the toilet
Two sips from bein alcoholic
Nine hundred ninety nine thou from bein rich but now I'm all for it
My man saw it like Dionne Warwick
A wiser team, for a wiser dream we could all score with
The cartel Argentina coke with the nina 
Up in the hotel, smokin on sessamina
Trina got the fishscale between her
The way the bitch shook her ass yo the dogs never seen her
She got me back livin sweeter, fresh Caesar
Guess, David Robinson's, Walle' moccasins
Bitches blow me while hoppin in the drop-  BM
Word is bond son, I had that bitch down on my shit like this



 
Growin up project-struck, lookin for luck dreamin
Scopin the large niggaz beamin, check what I'm seein
Cars, ghetto stars pushin ill Europeans
G'n, heard about them old timers OD'n
Young, early 80's, throwin rocks at the crazy lady
Worshippin every word them rope rockin niggaz gave me
The street raised me up, givin a f*ck
I thought Jordan's and a gold chain was livin it up
I knew the dopes, the pushers, the addicts everybody
Cut out of class, just to smoke blunts and drink naughty
Ain't that funny?    Gettin put on to crack money
With all the gunplay, paintin the kettle black hungry
A case of beers in the staircase I wasted years
Some niggaz went for theirs, flippin coke as they career
But I'm a rebel stressin, to pull out of the heat no doubt


 
Damn!    Look how muh-f*ckers use a nigga
Just use me for whatever the f*ck they want
I don't get to say shit
Just grab me, just do what the f*ck they want
Sell me, throw me away
Niggaz just don't give a f*ck about a nigga like me right?
Like I'm a f... I'm a gun, shit
It's like I'm a motherf*ckin gun
I can't believe this shit....
Word up.. (word up..)

I seen some cold nights and bloody days
They grab and me bullets spray
They use me wrong so I sing this song 'til this day
My body is cold steel for real
I was made to kill, that's why they keep me concealed
Under car seats they sneak me in clubs
Been in the hands of mad thugs
They feed me when they load me with mad slugs
Seventeen precisely, one in my head
They call me Desert Eagle, semi-auto with lead
I'm seven inches four pounds, been through so many towns
Ohio to Little Rock to Canarsie, livin harshly
Beat up and battered, they pull me out
I watch as niggaz scattered, makin me kill
But what I feel it never mattered
When I'm empty I'm quiet, findin myself fiendin to be fired
A broken safety, niggaz place me in shelves
under beds, so I beg for my next owner to be a thoroughbred
Keep me full up with hollow heads

[Chorus: Nas (repeat 2X)]

How you like me now?    I go blaow
It's that shit that moves crowds makin every ghetto foul
I might have took your first child
Scarred your life, crippled your style
I gave you power
I made you buck wild

 
Always I'm in some shit, my abdomen is the clip
The barrel is my dick, uncircumcised
Pull my skin back and cock me, I bust off when they unlock me
Results of what happens to niggaz shock me
I see niggaz bleedin runnin from me in fear, stunningly tears
fall down the eyes of these so-called tough guys, for years
I've been used in robberies, givin niggaz heart to follow me
Placin peoples in graves, funerals made cause I was sprayed
I was laid in a shelf, with a grenade
Met a wrecked-up tech with numbers on his chest that say 
Five-two-oh-nine-three-eight-five and zero
Had a serial defaced, hopin one day, police would place
where he came from, a name or some sort of person to claim him
Tired of murderin, made him wanna be a plain gun
But yo I had some other plans, like the next time the beef is on
I make myself jam right in my owner's hand



 
Yo, weeks went by and I'm surprised
Still stuck in the shelf with all the things that an outlaw hides
Besides me it's bullets, two vests and then a nine
There's a grenade in a box, and that tech that kept cryin
Cause he ain't been cleaned in a year, he's rusty as clear
He's bout to fall to pieces, cause of his murder career
Yo, I can hear somebody comin in, open the shelf
His eyes bubblin, he said, "It was on"
I felt his palm troubled him shakin
Somebody stomped him out, his dome was achin
He placed me on his waist, the moment I've been waitin
My creation was for blacks to kill blacks
It's gats like me that accidentally, go off, makin niggaz memories
But this time, it's done intentionally
He walked me outside, saw this cat
Cocked me back, said, "Remember me?"
He pulled the trigger but I held on, it felt wrong
Knowing niggaz is waiting in hell for 'im
He squeezed harder, I didn't budge, sick of the blood
Sick of the thugs, sick of wrath of the, next man's grudge
What the other kid did was pull out, no doubt
A newer me in better shape, before he lit out, he lead the chase
My owner fell to the floor, his wig split so fast
I didn't know he was hit, it's over with
Heard mad niggaz screamin, niggaz runnin, cops is comin
Now I'm happy, until I felt somebody else grab me
Damn!



It's just the likeness, of Isrealites mist, that made me write this
A slight twist, of lime rhyme, be chasin down your prime time
Food for thought or rather mind wine
The Don Juan, features the freak shit, my thesis
on how we creep quick, f*ckin your wife that ain't so secret
It's mandatory - see that pussy, they hand it to me
I got no game, it's just some bitches understand my story
There ain't no drama that my niggaz never handle for me
My gator brand is Maurry, walkin through rough land before me
where the snakes put a smile on they face, hopin and prayin I'm stuck
Scopin they lay in the cut, weighin my luck
Player haters play this in cell blocks and rock stages
Winkin at some females cops with cocked gauges
Really it's papers I'm addicted to, wasn't for rap then I'll be stickin you
The mag inside the triple goose
Face down on the floors, the routine
Don't want hear nobody blow steam, just cream or it's a smoke screen
Imagine that - that's why I hardly kick the braggin raps
I zone, to each his own and this ghetto inhabitant

[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown (repeat 2X)]

Watch dem niggas that be close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

 
Now how can I perfect this (uhh, what)
livin reckless, die for my necklace
Crime infected, drivin a Lexus with a death wish
Jettin, checkin my message on the speaker
Boppin to Mona Lisa brown reefer, ten G's, gun and my Visa
CD crankin, doin ninety on the Franklin-D-Roosevelt
No seat belt, drinkin and thinkin
My man caught a bad one son, niggaz is frightened
Secret indictments, adds on to one seekin enlightment
My Movado says seven, the God hour, that's if you follow
traditions started by the school not far from the Apollo
My "F*ck Tommorrow" motto through the eyes of Pablo
Escobar the desperado - word to Cus D'Amato

[Chorus: Nas and Foxy Brown]

Got to watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways

 
Some niggaz watch you (uh) see you when you think on the low
Ain't hard to spot you, you swore to keep it real after you blow
Three ki's, new V's, went to Anguilla with your hoe
Stayed around the hood, smoothest cat, gettin the dough
Them old timers, advise you to them problems that's ahead
Drama with the Feds, not listenin just bobbin your head
Your Roley shinin, thinkin to yourself nobody's takin mine
At the same time, your hoe is gettin snatched from behind
Put in the van, where's the hundred grand, script in her hand
From all the ice, wouldn't you know -
- you knew these niggaz all your life
What made them mark you victim, you f*cked up somehwere down the line
now they had to target your Wisdom
She took em to your place, straight to your safe
You doubted it could happen sick of yappin
Dump in your ride, headed to your side
Puffin ganja get to your crib, can't find her
Just a reminder shit and have your stash house where you crash out
Coulda passed out, your coke was gone, now you assed out
Dead bitches tell no lies, you should use your eyes


Got to watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do (what, hah)
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you (mmm)
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
Watch dem niggas that's close to you (uhh)
And make sure they do what they supposed to do
Cause you know they be thinkin about smokin you (uh-huh)
Never personal, nowadays, it's the ways
(uhh)







"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that" [repeat 2X]
[--> Kool Keith from the Ultramagnetic MC's 'Ease Back']

 
Yo; I never brag, how real I keep it, cause it's the best secret
I rock a vest, prestigious, Cuban link flooded Jesus
in a Lex watchin Kathie Lee and Regis
My actions are one with the seasons
A tec squeezin - executioner, winter time I rock a fur
Mega popular, center of attraction
Climaxin, my bitches they be laughin
They high from sniffin coke off a twenty-cent Andrew Jackson
City lights spark a New York night
Rossi and Martini sippin, Sergio Tachinni flippin mad pies
low price, I blow dice and throw em
Forty-five by my scrotum, manifest the "Do or Die" slogan
My niggaz roll in ten M3's
Twenty Gods poppin wheelies on Kawasaki's
Hip-Hop's got me on some ol', sprayin shots like a drumroll
Blankin out and never miscount the shells my gun hold
I don't stunt, I regulate
Henny and Sprite, I seperate, watchin crab niggaz marinate
I'm all about tecs and good jooks and sex
Israelite books, holdin government names from Ness
MC's are crawlin out, every hole in the slum
You be aight like blood money in a pimp's cum

"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..
.. for, you wack MC's"

 
Currency is made in trust of the Messiah
I'm spending it to get higher
Earth, Wind, and Fire singing reasons why I'm
up early, trustworthy is a nine that bust early
Sunshine on my grill, I spill
Remi on imaginary graves, put my hat on my waves
Latter Day Saints say religious praise
I dolo, challenge any team or solo
You must be buggin out, new to my shit, home on a furlough
Ask around, who's laid up, sharp and straight up
Mafioso, gettin niggaz wigs sprayed up
Skies are misty, my life's predicted by a gypsy
I'll one day walk into shots drunk off champange from Sicily
This be the drama, I'ma pause like a comma
in a sentence, paragraph's indented
Bloodshot red eyes, high, yellow envelopes of lye
Openin cigars, let tobacco fly
Condos are tuneproof, we're looking out the sky's moonroof
Shittin like gin and prune juice
Yo the system wants the coon's noose, hang em high
Courtrooms filled up, it's off the hook while I
just wrote a statement, like I'm facing twenty years
in the basement - chilling on the via with Mumia
for wearin chrome - I told the judge snakes slither 
like Sharon Stone, but like Capone I'm thrown (yo)

"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..
.. for, you wack MC's"
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..
.. for, you wack MC's"

 
Lyrical, ly-lyrical mission..
Lyrical..
Yo the time is wastin, I use the mind elevation
Dime sack lacin, court pen pacin
Individual, lyrical math abrasion
Psychic evaluation, the foulest nation
We livin in, dangerous lives, mad leak and battered wives
A lifestyle where bad streets is patternized
Wise men build and destroy
While the real McCoy dopefiend, named Detroit is still dealin boy
Coke suppliers actin biased
Cause rumors say that niggaz wear wires and we liars
But every night the gat's fired, and every day a rat's hired
I still remain the mack flyest in the phat Kani, it's --
-- just the killer in me, slash drug dealer MC
Ex-slug filler, semi mug peeler
Demi, bottles of Mo', yo simply follow me flow
Put poetry inside a crack pot and blow
rough holes for cracked out pussies and buttholes
Bring the G's and the D's roll, they can't touch those
Why shoot the breeze about it, when you could be about it? 
My degrees are routed, toward the peasy haired brick houses
instead of the fake medallions
Rich niggaz transport in thousands
Foreign cash exchange amountin to millions
Doors is locked, rocks is chopped, watch the cameras in the ceilings
Trick bitches catching mad feelings
Peelin off in the Lex Jeep, techniques is four-wheelin
I bet it be some shit when we connect with Stretch
When we catch them sex niggaz with the tecs you blessed, word
So now it's on, never wasted a slug,
Time is money when it comes to mine, take it in blood

"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that"
"I made it like that, I bought it like that, I'm livin like that..
.. for, you wack MC's" [repeat in background to fade]

Yeah, Capone-N-Noreaga
Yeah, yo, offical Queensbridge murderers
Mobb Deep keep it real though
Motherf*ckin AZ yo
'Mega, 'Mega, whatever
Scarlett O'Hara
Yo, Fox Boogie
East New York
Gambo, Brownsville
Wizard, Fort Rockaway
Big Jersey
Connecticut, D.C., Sudan
V.A. ?? N.C., L.A.
So on and so on...
Big Ha, Houston Fifth Ward
Black Ed, keep it real Moe..



All these niggaz talkin all this bullshit
("Nas is coming..")
better sit back, and watch what happens
("Nas is coming..")

 
The Golden Child chop that ass up, you was holdin out
Let the streets be the court - and corners hold the trial
Fatal not fictitious
I rock the cable 86 ??, foreign cars young with crazy bitches
Mad smoke makes me able to quote
Solicitin, ill editions of that Murder I WRote
A provocative plan, can bring a knot to my hand
As the pyramids that stand on   of the sand
In the heat of the moment, like Farrakhan said, we need atonement
Bulletproof glass, S-classes, chrome kitted up
Cali ?? lit it up
I didn't get touched checking my nuts, I stood up and lit a Dutch
Clutchin gats quick to bust
But knowin how these niggaz tattle
I sneak move get the drop, one shot, without the gun battle
So when you run the lead travel
I come through it's taboo
Ninety-six ways made to clap you

[Chorus: unknown singers]

Nas is comin, Nas is comin
Nas is comin.. (Nasty Nas is comin) Nas is comin
Nas is comin, Nas is comin
Nas is comin.. (Nasty Nas is comin) Nas is comin

 
In the black limo, Jack Daniels through the cracked window
I spot the fake, red dot his face, like a Hindu
Snatched the symbol, tied his hands too
Make examples, substantial amounts you owe, to the fam
Crew, Firm affliation, paper chasin
Chips glossy, rich Pablo Escabano
Sophisticado, Blazin hollows like Saddles
Rap apostle, nacho cheese, I'm Castro
compared to these niggaz who swear to be real
but impostors to Hoffa, Nas plague kills
Countin bills to send to all my jail niggaz who fell
From New York to L.A., Q.B. to C.P.T. for G.P.
A hundred G cars, Garcia Vegas cigars
Kani shit, mad jiggy
The clout, murder material serial scratched out
My name's passed out like it's somethin venereal
but back in stereo



 
From childbirth to hearses, flow like the Nile cover surface
I bit the fruit from the Serpent
Apocalyptic, get bent, stay splifted
Control the rap game you got it twisted
Dr. Dre way the 'Bridge say, shake dice and kiss it
Sip Crist', push the six with biscuit
Jeep full of chickens, pull up beside, have a listen y'all, Nas y'all
Fly gangsta, wavy hair teeth chipped in
My shit bump, in the courtroom drunk, links truck
rocky bracelet, cognac kernel never chase it
Rap hero, black DeNiro
Federal Bureau, tapped my line and got zero
Rap pro, diamond roll, hustlin low -
pro-file, white gold style, rakin bloody dough by the pile
Shot down, still alive he strugglin for the phone
Fo'-fo' blow him, when homicide comes, these three words are sung


Check this out
It's Nasty Nas, and Dr. Dre
Hahaha, East meets West
That's how we makin it happen
That's how it goes down for the nine-six
Aiyyo Nas let's get this money
Let's get paid
Sit back and watch all these motherf*ckin clowns out here
riffin and beefin about this BULLSHIT
Yo, heh
While they doin all that
we just gon' kick back with these honies, this Cristal
Hah, and party to the year 2G




Hehehe, that's right, that's right
Yeah, Nasty Nas, Dr. Dre
Makin it happen









This is what... this what they want huh?
This is what it's all about..
What?    Time to take Affirmative Action son
They just don't understand, youknowImean?
Niggaz comin sideways thinkin stuff is sweet man
Yknahmean?
Niggaz don't understand the four devils:
Lust.. Envy.. Hate.. Jealousy
Wicked niggaz man

Yo, sit back relax catchin contacts, sip your cog-nac
And let's all wash this money through this laundry mat
Sneak attack, a new cat sit back, worth   dollar
In fact, touch mines, and I'll react like a Rottweiler
Who pull the late, we play for high stakes at gunpoint
Catch em and break, undress em tie em with tape, no escape
The Corleone, fettucini Capone
Roam in your own zone or get kidnapped and clapped in your dome
We got it sewn, The Firm art of war is unknown
Lower your tone, face it, homicide cases get blown
Aristocrats, politickin daily with diplomats
See me I'm an official mack, Lex Coupe triple black


Criminal thoughts in the blue Porsche, my destiny's to be the new boss
That nigga Paulie gotta die - he too soft
That nigga's dead on, a key of her-oin, they found his head on
the couch with his dick in his mouth, I put the hit out
Yo, the smoothest killer since Bugsy, bitches love me
And Queens where my drugs be, I wear Guess jeans and rugbies
Yo my people from Medina they will see you
when you re-up on your heater all your cream go betweeen us
Real shit, my Desert Eagle got a ill grip
I chill with, niggaz that hit Dominican spots and steal bricks
My red beam, made a dread scream, and sprayed a Fed team
Corleone be turnin niggaz to fiends
U-Conn's and ninja black Lexus, 'Mega the pretty boy
with mafia connections it's The Firm nigga set it

 
Yo, my mind is seein through your design like blind fury
I shine jewelry sippin on crushed grapes, we lust papes
and push cakes inside the casket at Just wake
It's sickenin, he just finished biddin upstate
And now the projects, is talkin that somebody gotta die shit
It's logic, as long as it's nobody that's in my clique
My man Smoke, know how to expand coke, and Mr. Coffee
Feds cost me two mill' to get the system off me
"Life's a Bitch," but God-forbid the bitch divorce me
I'll be flooded with ice so hellfire can't scorch me
Cuban cigars meetin Foxy at Demars
Movin cars, your   papi Senor Escobar

[Foxy Brown]
In the black Camaro
Firm deep all my niggaz hail the blackest sparrow
Wallabee's be the apparel
Through the darkest tunnel, I got visions of multimillions
in the biggest bundle, in the Lex pushed by my nigga Jungle
He money bags got Moet, Sean Don
Bundle of sixty-two, they ain't got a clue what we about to do
My whole team we shittin hard like Czar
Sosa, Foxy Brown, Cormega, and Escobar
I keep a fat marquis piece, laced in all the illest snake skin
Armani sweaters Carolina Hebrera
Be The Firm baby, from BK to the 'Bridge
My nigga Wiz, operation Firm Biz, so what the deal is
I keep a phat jew-el, sippin Crist-ies
Sittin on   of fifty grand in the Nautica Van, uhh!
We stay incogni' like all them thug niggaz in Marcy
The Gods, they praise Allah with visions of Gandhi
Bet it on, my whole crew is Don Juan
On Cayman Island with a case of Cristal and Papa Chula spoke
Nigga with them Cubans that snort coke
Raw though, an ounce mixed wit leak that's pure though
Flippin the bigger picture, the bigger nigga with the cheddar
Was mad dripper, he had a f*ckin villa in Manilla
We got to flee to Panama, but wait it's half and half
Keys is one and two-fifth, so how we flip
Thirty-two grams raw, chop it in half, get sixteen, double it times three
We got forty-eight, which mean a whole lot of cream
Divide the profit by four, subtract it by eight
We back to sixteen, now add the other two that 'Mega bringin through
So let's see, if we flip this other key
Then that's more for me, mad coke and mad leak
Plus a five hundred, cut in half is two-fifty
Now triple that times three, we got three quarters of another key
The Firm baby, volume one uhh..


Uhh.. (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Q.B. since 1933 (know dat)
To nine-six (nine-six motherf*cker)
Check the shit

Nine-six
Escobar 600

 
Check the shit
My mindset, son got wet, I'm vexed really
They snatched off his Rolex, smacked his bitch silly
Why niggaz actin illy word to Will he bout to feel it
I feel it, he shoulda been dealt wit it
Them niggaz sour, they put to much flour in they coke
And got the nerve to wonder WHY THEY BROKE
While we was gleamin, niggaz was scheamin
Seen the ill Beamers beamin
Triple-beam and doublin cream, had em feenin
to get they fingers on the dosa, I called Sosa
Sosa, these niggaz hit the God, bring the toaster
Meet me in the 'Bridge I'm bout to go loca
Left my 'rat beggin me to stay and stroke her
He came through with two fly bitches, Venus and Vicious
wit two macs inside the Volvo, what up God, I'm still sober
I need some Henn' to bend me over
My nigga Hav got a soldier
It's gettin down it's goin down kid (I got this, I got this)
I heard he might not live, I'm holdin back tears
Told these broads, to put it in gear 
with two females that don't smile diggin they style yo
Whattup son, these niggaz done started somethin wild
You know the clique well, Ramel with the gold in his grill
Tried to get a name holdin the steel, I paid attention to the females
Maintain bitches when it get real
Sos' pulled me close and told me the deal
He said both hoes'll peel, spray shots and reload
and still handle the wheel, point em out smoke a Phil' then chill
I layed back Escobar status, knowin The Firm got it cornered
We on it, shit we was born wit

Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
I finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up
Spark the lye, Q.B.C. yo it's do or die
In this, business and trifeness
We finesse this, for R.D., we chef shit
Perfect shit, Albert Einstein minds connect wit
dangerous sons, step back let the tech lift
Lift you up, bless you wit a shorty then we set you up

 
Hold it right there pull over
That nigga right there inside the Rover
I knew he'd be right here, I told ya
Let's get him now, look at him smile, ice Bulova
Polo pullover, big links and rockin boulders
He's stuntin, after he left my man like that
without a fair chance to fight back, BUT I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
He never seen us, Sos' gave the mac to Venus
and Vicious, lookin delicious, handle yo' bidness
and step to him, shake yo' ass try to screw him
Do what ya gotta do to get to him
A tight parasuco, with young faces
can turn niggaz Buttafuco, of all ages, they was amused
by the way they walked, way they talked
Only if they knew these girls'd spray New York
if they had to, heard him ask Venus, "Could I have you?"
He jumped out a Jeep, heard her tell him, "Don't grab Boo"
They started chattin, was only bout a minute, flat when
they jumped in the back of the Jeep laughin
We followed them pollyin, he thought the hoes were Somalian
Probably wanted to hit the Holiday Inn
I grabbed the phone and called the Mobb and them
We layed low about a hour or so, these bitches movin too slow
We both holdin, what if them wild hoes started foldin? 
Sosa, said say no more, we started rollin
Before we got in they must have shot him, security wildin
There the girls go, hurry up we out in
the 940, me Sosa and two shorties
The punk niggaz got murdered in the orgy

Q.B.C.
QueensBridge motherf*cker
